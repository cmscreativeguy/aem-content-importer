UPLOAD CONTENT TOOL TUTORIAL
----------------------------

1) You don't have any zip file created and don't want to create it. So, you have to upload source files to transform in the
repository (for example using WEBDAV) and create the path where it's going to be saved the transformation files. After
that, you have to fill out form params with corresponding src (source files uploaded in repository), select the transformer,
the corresponding target in the repository you've just created, indicate the master file if it's necessary and 
click execute button to start the process. If everything it's ok a green box indicated that will be appeared. Or else, an error red box message.

2)You have created a zip file with all necessary source files to transform. Remember that you have to add a new file inside
the zip it must become the first one in it with the necessary information for making the transformation to work properly the process. Here an example of config file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties>
 <entry key="dita-transformer">com.adobe.aem.importer.impl.DITATransformerXSLTImpl</entry> --> Transformer to apply (It's necessary the whole package name of transformer class it'll be in charge of it)
 <entry key="src">/var/aem-importer/import2</entry> --> Source path to import files from zip
 <entry key="target">/content/pando</entry> -> Target path where store transformation files
 <entry key="masterFile">mcloud.ditamap</entry> -> Name of master file
 
 
 EXPLAIN BETTER THIS PARAMS
 
 <entry key="xslt-transformer">net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl</entry> -> Right now it's constant, because it's used this class to the transformation Dita XSLT.
 <entry key="xslt-file">/apps/aem-importer/resources/dita-to-content.xsl</entry>
 <entry key="tempFolder">/var/aem-importer/tmp</entry>
 <entry key="packageTpl">/apps/aem-importer/resources/package-tpl</entry>
 <entry key="graphicFolders">images,graphics,Graphics</entry>
</properties>

When you've added this file and it's the first in the zip, you're able to uploaded using the button or dragging and dropping the file in the box that
it's fit for that. Click execute button to start the process. If everything it's ok a green box indicated that will be appeared. Or else, an error red box message.

P.S: Notice that if you added a zip file with the corresponding configuration and fill out some form params, they'll be overrided by zip file config values.
