	 <p>A 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword> Organization is the entity that
		enables an administrator to configure groups and users, and to control single
		sign-on in the 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword>. The Organization functions like a
		log-in company that spans all the 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword> products and solutions. Most often, an
		Organization is your company name. However, a company can have many
		Organizations. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Each Organization has a unique
