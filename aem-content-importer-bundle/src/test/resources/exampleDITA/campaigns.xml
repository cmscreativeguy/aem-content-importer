    <p> A campaign has a specific goal, which is tracked by metrics. To run, a
		campaign requires the matching of the visitor's context with the rules set in
		the campaign, and the delivery of content according to the technical
		constraints of the location's channel. 
	 </p>
    <p> Sometimes campaigns are organized in programs (called portfolios in the
		Adobe Marketing Cloud). Typically, campaign is used in a specific channel
		instead of a cross-channel campaign. This is due to the evolution of campaign
		management tools, which are very channel-oriented.
