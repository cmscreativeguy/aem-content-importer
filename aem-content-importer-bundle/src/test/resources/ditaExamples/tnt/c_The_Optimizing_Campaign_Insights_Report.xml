    <p class="- topic/p ">For example, if an optimizing campaign defines an "on
		mobile device" segment and two experiences, "small screen creative" and "large
		screen creative," the predictive model might identify a relationship between
		visitors belonging to the "on mobile device" segment and conversion on the
		"small screen creative" experience. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">While this example might seem obvious, the insight
		report might show more subtle relationships that can be leveraged in future
		tests and targeting, both on your site and through other channels. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">For example, a stated relationship between your urban
		professional segment and Experience B might make you critically examine the
		content of Experience B and to notice that it includes colorful, creative
		offers. You might choose to validate this insight in a future test and if
		confirmed, construct a targeted Display Ad Campaign with colorful content to
		urban professional site visitors.
