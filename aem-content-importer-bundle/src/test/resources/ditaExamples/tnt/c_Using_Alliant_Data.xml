		  over 130 million consumer profiles packed with rich, behavioral,
		  transaction-level customer data updated monthly by many of the world’s leading
		  direct response marketers. The data represents active buyers in over 280 lines
		  of direct-to-consumer offers and contains transaction-level information on new
		  orders, product types and billing transactions. The Alliant attributes are
		  calculated from a transactional database covering 135+ million consumers who
		  have purchased products directly from marketers utilizing online and offline
		  channels. The Alliant Data and the Census data are compiled differently.

          <li id="li_5EC2B6C096C548168A82325B056BE189" class="- topic/li "> The
			 score groups are derived from the count of US census households within each zip
			 code. Alliant delivers the rankings in 20 buckets (5% of US households in each
			 bucket) and Adobe rolls those buckets up into five equal groups. Thus, each
			 score group comprises 20% of total US households. 
		  </li>
          <li id="li_9E811C5D767041D38CC8C82AEB890876" class="- topic/li "> For
			 this reason, zip codes counts are not particularly relevant for analysis. In
			 more sparsely populated areas, the differences in performance are more
			 pronounced. Conversely, large zip codes will tend more to the mean for a given
			 behavior, thus falling to the middle. Thus, the ends of the scale tend to have
			 more (and less populated) zip codes, but an equal number of households.
