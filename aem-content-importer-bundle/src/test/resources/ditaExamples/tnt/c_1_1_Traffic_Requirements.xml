    <p class="- topic/p ">Visitor data is used to see how different pieces of
		content perform, and to make valid predictions for future visitors. It is
		important not to include more content options in the campaign than the traffic
		levels can support. In the campaign edit page, a traffic estimator updates as
		locations and offers are added to the campaign, so it is easy to monitor how
		much traffic is required to sustain the campaign. This traffic estimator can
		serve as a guideline to determine how many offers and locations can be included
		in the campaign while allowing enough traffic to hit each offer for the model
		to determine a prediction. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> You can edit the conversion rate in the traffic
		estimator. Enter your typical conversion rate, based on people seeing the
		content areas and then performing whatever action you deem as the final
		conversion in the campaign. This could be the click, final conversion, and so
		on. Although you want your conversion rate to increase as the campaign runs,
		using your baseline conversion rate works well as a guide for campaign size and
		complexity. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> This conversion rate is used to calculate the
		traffic required for conversion-based campaigns and revenue based campaigns.
		Far less data is required to optimize to conversion because a binary event,
		converted or not, is simpler to model than a continuous variable such as
		revenue. The example below shows the Traffic Estimator calculations for
		conversion and revenue per visit for the same campaign.
