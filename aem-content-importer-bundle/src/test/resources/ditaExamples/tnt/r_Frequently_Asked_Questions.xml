		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">When will my campaign start?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">By default, campaigns are set to begin "When
		  approved" and to end "When deactivated." However, you can set the start and end
		  dates manually, including time of day, when you create or edit a campaign.
		  Campaigns that do not specify time of day begin at midnight and end at
		  23:59:59. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b "> How are impressions, visits and new
			 visitors counted?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> See 
		  <xref
			href="c_About_the_Data.xml#concept_2D9FEDE8F94A485DAC86D611BFBDC844"
			type="concept" format="dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">About the
			 Data</xref>. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Do visitors see the same content
			 throughout the life of the campaign?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> By default in most campaigns and tests, returning
		  visitors, even if converted, will see the same content through the life of the
		  campaign. This behavior can be changed by using the advanced settings for
		  success metrics. (See 
		  <xref
			href="r_Success_Metric_Advanced_Options.xml#reference_03C2054D36E846DD9A7C9878E816E0C8"
			type="reference" format="dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">Success
			 Metric Advanced Options</xref>.) The exception is the Landing Page test which
		  can use experience level targeting to force a returning visitor to see new
		  content. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">I am concerned with visitor privacy. What
			 data is sent to Adobe servers?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Adobe does not collect personally identifiable
		  information. Adobe collects at a minimum visitors, clicks and conversions for
		  all tests. All data captured by Adobe Target is linked to a visitor ID, but
		  there is no personal data related to that visitor ID. At an aggregate level,
		  the success metrics defined in a campaign are tracked. This data is not
		  available at an individual visitor level. Visitor profile data is stored per
		  visitor, but is linked to the visitor only by the anonymous visitor ID or 
		  <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mboxPCId</codeph> value. 
		</p> 
		<p> For information on the current state of global privacy, how it's
		  changing, and how it might affect you and your business, view the

		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Can I display more than one offer in an
			 mbox?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">No. An mbox may display only one offer. However you
		  may create a larger mbox and use a larger offer to display several elements of
		  the Web site. See 
		  <xref
		  href="t_Creating_a_Whole-Page_Mbox.xml#task_5E71B81283444DB3882D2E1EBFEE0B64"
		  type="task" format="dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">Creating a Whole
			 Page Mbox</xref>. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">How do offers and mboxes impact search
			 engines and automated browsing utilities?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> Most search engine robots do not execute
		  JavaScript, so the content served in an offer does not affect search results or
		  search engine rankings. Your Default Content, because it is still on the page,
		  continues to influence the search engine results as it would without an mbox. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Will an mbox add another cookie to the
			 current list already returned by our Web application?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> Yes, another First Party cookie is added, named
		  "mbox." Third party cookies can be used as well in instances where you need to
		  track the visitor across domains. Speak with your account representative to set
		  this up. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Will the mbox code, which automatically
			 attaches to a body onLoad() event, conflict with other embedded JavaScript in
			 our pages?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> No. Code is added at the end of the 
		  <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">onLoad()</codeph> event, in
		  order to ensure that it does not conflict with other JavaScript calls in your
		  pages. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">We have an internally-built proprietary
			 content management system. Do we continue use this or have a separate interface
			 to manage content with AdobeTarget?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Target coexists perfectly with your content
		  management tool. You define the content to be delivered and where it should
		  reside. The tested content can be static or dynamic HTML and uses the same
		  format as your content management tool. You can choose to create offers that
		  point to content stored on your content management system. You can also store
		  the content directly in Target, bypassing your content management system. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Can I track conversion off-line? For
			 example, people register on my Web site, then turn into actual clients after
			 they speak to our representatives by phone.</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Use the combined offline conversion/third-party
		  profile API. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Is a first party cookie or a third party
			 cookie dropped onto the visitor's browser?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">By default, Test&amp;Target drops a first party
		  cookie. You can also use a third party cookie if you need to track visitors
		  across different domains. A first party cookie. See

		<p class="- topic/p ">

		<p class="- topic/p "> Yes. See

		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">How many mboxes can I have on one
			 page?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">It's recommended that you limit your mboxes to five
		  to seven per page. However you can also use a whole-paged-size mbox and use
		  large offers to display as many elements of the Web site as you need. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Does the mbox.js reference need to be on

		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">The mbox.js must be referenced on every page with
		  an mbox. See

		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">What do the confidence bars in the
			 reports indicate?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Four bars indicates the highest level of
		  confidence. You can hover over the percentage bars to see the confidence
		  percentage. See

		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Can I insert an mbox within an mbox? For
			 example, an mbox with a small piece of dynamic content inside a static page
			 sized mbox? 
		  </b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Yes. Place a reference to the mbox within the HTML
		  offer itself. 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Warning!</b> Do not place the smaller
		  mbox within the default content of the larger mbox. The consequence will be a
		  flashing page for the visitor. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Where should I host my images, code and
			 other content? 
		  </b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">You can host offers on your server, on Adobe
		  servers or a third party server. Use the method best suited to your
		  architecture. In the offers, insert a relative or absolute URL to refer to the
		  content, as best suited to your file structure. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Why are some of the features grayed out
			 in the interface? 
		  </b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Depending on your contract level, you may not have
		  access to all the features. Speak with your Sales Representative or account
		  representative if you have questions about this. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Which campaigns are using my mbox? 
		  </b>

		<p class="- topic/p ">Yes. See

		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">See

		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Can I change the time zone that my
			 reports refer to?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Yes. To change your time zone after signup, ask
		  your account representative to change it for you. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">If I want to change the success metric
			 for my automated campaign, can I simply change it, or do I need to create a
			 brand new campaign for the modeling to start working with my new metric?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">As long as the conversion point stays the same
		  (i.e. still the order confirmation page, not changing to the shopping cart
		  page) then it is best to simply change the success metric for the modeling
		  system. The modeling system quickly updates upon saving the campaign to build
		  new models. 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">If the conversion point changes, then it is best to
		  copy the campaign, make the required conversion changes, and start this new
		  campaign fresh." 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Why does the automated traffic estimator
			 change when I change the success metric (conversion rate vs AOV vs RPV)?</b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">Revenue per visitor and average order value require
		  real numbered values instead of binary success/failure event like conversion
		  rate. This means that there is more noise in the revenue-based data, and it may
		  be harder for the system to discern which of the options is best to display.
		  Therefore, it takes more traffic for RPV and AOV-based campaigns to be
		  successful.

		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p "> 
		  <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">How big is the mbox.js? 
		  </b> 
		</p> 
		<p class="- topic/p ">About 12k. This size can be affected in several
		  different ways, including compression level or adding custom JavaScript to your
		  mbox.js. Compression can either be weak or strong, with about a 3K variance
		  between them.

		<p class="- topic/p ">
