      <note>As of April 17, 2014, the information in this section has been
		  deprecated, and is replaced by the 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/a4t/" format="http" scope="external">Adobe Analytics as the Reporting Source for
			 Adobe Target</xref> functionality. Adobe is continuing to support the former
		  integration methods, but it is recommended that you use the new functionality.

    <p class="- topic/p ">Some possible uses include: 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <ul id="ul_D934ADCA3FE243BC83481E081B29AD51" class="- topic/ul ">
        <li id="li_21D28950B1464C099BCEE5C689359404" class="- topic/li ">
		  Measuring the success of campaigns through your reporting and analytics KPIs. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_B4C07087FCCD448CA03C92276A119CF9" class="- topic/li ">
		  Subrelating campaign and experience data with Analytics conversion variables. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_6C1BF09B6E6446578DC96E806E7824CB" class="- topic/li ">
		  Subrelating other Analytics reports with campaign and experience traffic data. 
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">By leveraging data in Adobe Analytics, you can drill
		into your Target experiences using subrelations and detect high performing
		segments that are ripe for future tests and potentially targeted campaigns. The
		Analytics report displays Analytics conversion data rather than Target
		conversion data. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">When an integration offer is activated, this special
		offer is served to all display mboxes, in addition to the regular offer. Think
		of it as "piggybacking" on a campaign's regular offers. It is invisible to the
		visitor because it is JavaScript. You only need to configure it once and it
		will send data about the current experiences for each campaign on the page.
		With the data now available on the page, the Analytics tag sends it to the
		Analytics server, along with all other Analytics data. There is no additional
		contract or usage cost for this integration. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">To visualize this, consider normal Target behavior
		with no integration, depicted in the image below. The Web site www.acme.com has
		two campaigns on its home page, a banner test and a hero image test. Each
		campaign contains a single mbox, so when the page is rendered, the server
		serves an offer for each experience (two total).

    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Now consider the behavior with the integration
		enabled in the image below. Notice how the campaign name and experience name
		"piggybacks" on top of the regular offers. With the campaign and experience
		data now available on the page, the Analytics tag sends the Target data to its
		own server so that a marketer can later examine campaign and experience data in
		an Analytics report.
