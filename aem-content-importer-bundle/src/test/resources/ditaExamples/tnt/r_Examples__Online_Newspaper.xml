        <b>Basic Engagement</b>
      </p>
      <p>An online newspaper tags all pages with a global mbox to track
		  site-wide page count, score, and time on site. These engagement types are used
		  to compare engagement of different experiences in a test of two front page
		  layouts: "Text heavy" and "Picture heavy." 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b> Finer Granularity</b>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to defining a success metric called "Total Page Count"
		  capturing "Page Count per visit" engagement, the publisher decides to track how
		  a different creative impacts engagement in different site sections. The
		  publisher defines additional success metrics, including "Sport Section Page
		  Count" targeted with a rule target matching "sports" in the url, which only
		  counts pages in the sports section, providing the marketer with more granular
		  comparison of engagement for each experience. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Visitor Segmentation</b>
      </p>
      <p>The online newspaper's search marketing team runs several ad campaigns
		  on the major search engines. By defining segments like "From Google," "From
		  Yahoo," and "From Microsoft," the publisher breaks down these success metrics
		  by search engine. They might discover that Google adwords bring visitors with
		  disproportionally high page counts for the "Text Heavy" experience and justify
		  a larger search spend in the future. Maybe Yahoo ads yield traffic with an
		  affinity to the Entertainment section when they see a "Picture Heavy"
		  treatment, and justifies a larger ad spend next summer when the newspaper plans
		  to highlight summer movie blockbusters. And maybe when presented with a "Text
		  Heavy" experience, Microsoft visitors tend to navigate to highly valuable pages
		  as determined by a high visit score engagement. Similar segmentation can be
		  accomplished to determine the best creative to show visitors coming from
		  specific affiliate traffic partners. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b> Speed to Objective</b>
      </p>
      <p>The site is divided into three types of pages: the home page, section
		  pages, and article pages. This particular publisher specializes in placing
		  extremely targeted (and lucrative!) ads in each article and is curious which of
		  the two layouts more quickly drive visitors to their first article. In addition
		  to the already defined success metric capturing time on site engagement on any
		  mbox, the publisher creates a second metric capturing time on site, which is
		  targeted to article pages. Due to the behavior of 
		  <xref href="c_Time_on_Site.xml#concept_089A2B22D71F4CA4970A4369691F6DA4" type="concept" format="dita" scope="local">time on site engagement</xref>, this
		  causes the timer to start when the user first reaches the article page. By
		  subtracting this time value from the total visit time value, the publisher can
		  determine the time needed to first view an article. For example, if total time
		  spent is 130 seconds and time spent after first seeing an article page is 90
		  seconds, it can be assumed that it took 40 seconds to click into an article. Of
		  course, not every user clicked on an article, so this is just an approximation.
		  
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Maximizing Exit Link Revenue</b>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to ad revenue, the newspaper publisher makes money when
		  visitors click sponsored links to its affiliate partners. By defining a success
		  metric capturing "score" engagement, the publisher can turn each affiliate
		  link's destination URL into a 
		  <xref href="c_Using_a_Redirector.xml#concept_451731358AA64789AD0DA3BAAF2DF72C" type="concept" format="dita" scope="local">redirector</xref>, passing the score
		  (perhaps as a CPC dollar amount) to Target before redirecting to the partner
		  site. Summary report analysis determines which experience is generating higher
		  exit link revenue. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Optimizing Display and Email Campaigns</b>
      </p>
      <p>Display ads and email messaging can be tested. Success metrics
		  capturing engagement, such as number of pages and score per visit, can be used
		  for display ads and email testing.
