    <p class="- topic/p ">Any profile attribute passed from an mbox or created
		in the profile attributes page is automatically included in the training data
		records. Data passed in via the third-party profile API and via mbox parameters
		from display mboxes also contribute to the training data. Segments added to
		automated decisioning campaigns contribute to the training data for that
		campaign. These methods allow marketers to add data into the system from
		offline sources, order management systems, and CRM systems. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> Marketers can also have a valuable impact on the
		modeling system by grouping data that the system would otherwise not view as a
		set. If there are value sets for variables or sets of variables that are known
		to be valuable for a business, either through offline analysis, data warehouse
		data, or direct marketing analysis, then these groupings should be saved as
		profile attributes. These sets can provide valuable information to the model
		that the model would not collect itself. For example, if a marketing
		organization considers "luxury loyalists" as people who have purchased more
		than five times and spent a total of $5,000, then grouping those two data
		points into a profile attribute or segment means the modeling system considers
		those two data points as a combined attribute.
