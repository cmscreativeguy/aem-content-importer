    <p class="- topic/p ">The scorer compares the visitor's profile and
		behavior with the training data, scores each content option, and selects the
		best set of offers, or experience, to return to the visitor's page. It is
		important to note that 10% of traffic is set to be randomly served content. The
		model serves randomly to avoid becoming stuck on one option. For example, if
		one option began with a higher probability of conversion, the algorithm would
		favor that option and begin to re-enforce its decision with excessive serves of
		that option. To ensure the algorithm continues to consider the possibility of
		other options, these options are randomly explored to gauge their performance.
		For the other 90%, the scorer follows a series of steps to choose the best
		content option for each mbox in the campaign. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> Scoring decisions are made at the modeling group
		level. A modeling group is a set of offers with similar marketing themes. Users
		have complete control over the modeling groups, and can determine which offers
		should go in which group. More detail is available in 
		<xref href="t_Creating_a_11_Campaign.xml#task_CE002DF9573947EFAE66CCEC6CA21541" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Creating a 1:1 Campaign?></xref>.
		
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> Two scores per modeling group are determined for
		each person: a personalized profile score and a generalized score. The
		personalized score is how the model expects each person to react to the content
		based on his individual variables. The generalized score is the sum of all the
		response rates of all offers within a modeling group for users in the random
		serve group. This establishes a general popularity hierarchy of modeling
		groups. The personalized score and generalized score are added together, and
		this combined score is used to determine the score for each modeling group for
		which the visitor is eligible. Because the generalized score includes more
		traffic, temporal changes are reflected much more quickly than in the
		personalized score. Adding them together provides the best opportunity for
		lift. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> If a visitor has no profile values that match the
		variables in the model, then the generalized score is used. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> Once the model runs, content is chosen for new
		visits based on what the model predicts these new visitors will respond to
		favorably. The score from the model is evaluated with a real-time reaction
		update model to choose the best content to deliver. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> Targeting criteria must be met for each offer first,
		and then the modeling group with the top score is selected. If there are
		multiple locations in the campaign, the scorer picks the top-scored modeling
		group for the second location, ignoring any options that are not allowed due to
		experience exclusions. Through this process, a modeling group is selected for
		each location in the campaign. If multiple offers exist in the winning modeling
		group, then one of those offers is chosen randomly for delivery. Targeting
		criteria and experience exclusions are described in 
		<xref href="t_Creating_a_11_Campaign.xml#task_CE002DF9573947EFAE66CCEC6CA21541" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Creating a 1:1 Campaign?></xref>.
		
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> Sophisticated algorithms are used to determine the
		"best score" for a particular profile and offer set. When a campaign launches,
		the model does not know what is the best to serve, so each option is served an
		equal amount. However, the system learns very quickly, so a strictly equal
		split happens only at the very beginning of a new campaign. As the system's
		knowledge quickly increases, it begins to favor the options that indicate
		success. It takes input from the lower performing modeling groups as well, via
		the exploration traffic, to ensure that its decisions are correct. Finally, the
		model score is influenced by the real-time reaction tracking to reach a final
		score for each modeling group and mbox combination to determine the experience
		to deliver to each visitor.
