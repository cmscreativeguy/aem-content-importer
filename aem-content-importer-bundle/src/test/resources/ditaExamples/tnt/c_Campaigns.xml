		  test 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">An A/B test (sometimes referred to as an A/B...N
			 test) compares two or more versions of your Web site content to see which best
			 lifts your conversions, sales, or registrations. A/B tests are well-suited for
			 large changes that might involve new layouts or drastically different
			 treatments of the elements. If your test design does not easily break down into
			 individual page elements, you should run an A/B test before a multivariate
			 test. Also, if you anticipate large interactions between elements, an A/B test
			 is the best choice. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_2B3210C254204621AE80D4EBD0D4A238" class="- topic/li ">
		  Multivariate test 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">A multivariate test tests many elements and
			 variations with less traffic and fewer combinations than A/B tests require. A
			 balanced test design is generated for you. 
		  </p><p class="- topic/p ">Use multivariate tests to optimize a page. For
			 example, you might have the layout you want, and you're looking to optimize the
			 individual assets on the page (such as, what's the best image to have in this
			 spot, what's the best headline, and so on). For a predetermined page layout, a
			 multivariate test is your best bet for quickly and accurately optimizing the
			 elements on the page.

		  page test 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">A landing page test allows you to use targeting
			 to display different landing page content for different visits. Otherwise, the
			 landing page shows the same content for each visit. A landing page test
			 compares different versions of the page to help you see which version of the
			 landing page produces more successful results.
