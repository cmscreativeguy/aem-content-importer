	 <p>Digital marketers maintain complete control by quickly and easily
		testing multiple onsite and offsite scenarios, and providing their visitors
		with the most relevant content possible. Test a number of versions of a Web
		page against a baseline sample to determine which version is most effective at
		improving the success of your site. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">For example, you can test versions of your home page
		with different graphics and text to see which version leads the highest
		percentage of site visitors to purchase your products. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">You can also target Web page content to specific
		populations. You can target segments of visitors who respond most favorably to
		different page configurations, then lead each segment of visitors toward a
		successful outcome. For example, new visitors might be more likely to purchase
		less expensive products while loyal customers buy more expensive items. You can
		set up your page to display the products most likely to be purchased by each
		type of visitor. Or, you could only permit visitors from Google to enter a
		campaign or view a report broken down by visitors from Canada.

	 <p>Adobe Target provides two separate interfaces for Target. Both
		interfaces can be used side by side, so it's helpful to understand the key
		differences between Standard and Classic: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_FA86AFB416474A2D82364C3F26FB0CF4"> 
		<li id="li_AE788434B02D422A91DB937DFB4755CD"> 
		  <xref
		  href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/" format="http"
		  scope="external">Target Standard</xref> provides a visual interface for
		  creating and managing A/B tests and rules-based targeting activities. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_FEA7E3EBAB5144F28EB53B48006F53C8"> 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/tnt/help/"
		  format="http" scope="external">Target Classic</xref> (formerly Test&amp;Target)
		  provides the more detailed interface for managing more sophisticated tests on
		  more platforms. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p> The Standard interface offers an easier implementation strategy with
		your digital properties: just a single line of code on each page manages all
		communication required between your site and Adobe Target. Industry best
		practices are built in to Standard, and it is designed to be used by both new
		and experienced users. You can share data and results and collaborate easily
		with other team members who use the Adobe Marketing Cloud. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If you are new to Target or use Target to manage basic A/B tests and
		rules-based targeting activities, you might prefer the easy-to-use, visual,
		Standard interface. Experienced users might prefer Standard for more basic
		tests and Classic for more complex tests, or you might prefer to use the
		Classic interface only. Adobe plans to increase the functionality of the
		Standard interface in future releases. As this functionality increases, you can
		begin to perform more of your sophisticated optimization activities in
		Standard.
