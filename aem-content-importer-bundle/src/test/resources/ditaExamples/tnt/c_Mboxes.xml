	 on your Web page where content is displayed or user actions are tracked.

	 <p class="- topic/p ">An mbox is a "marketing box," a location on your Web
		page that can be configured to show different content in different situations.
		An mbox can also log the behavior of visitors to your site. Mboxes are defined
		in the code for each Web page. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">Mboxes are essential to campaigns and tests. You
		decide whether any mbox can do one, both, or none of the following: 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p "> 
	 <ul id="ul_3A0231020998417D842AAFCDD21E9538" class="- topic/ul "> 
		<li id="li_5F48E2FC5F3D4A8EA4D147A8264015E3" class="- topic/li "> Display
		  and swap content for visitors. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_B06FCEF8E3434AF482406B164008215F" class="- topic/li "> Log
		  visitor behavior in real-time. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p "> 
		<b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b "> Tip:</b> Prepare ahead for tests by
		placing mboxes around all of your Web site's key elements and tracking
		locations. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">For example, examine the following Web page: 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p "> 
		<image id="image_D9C021E547BD4BCC94360AD5EBD19DCD"
		href="graphics/mboxexample.png" placement="inline"
		class="- topic/image "></image> 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">In this example, an mbox has been highlighted at the
		top of the page. This mbox is set up to display a message customized by, or 
		<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">targeted to</i>, the location of the
		visitor. In this case, the visitor is from Utah, so the message displays
		information about the shipping time to locations in Utah. If the visitor were
		from California, the mbox might display the same offer customized to say "to
		California" or it might show an entirely different offer for visitors from
		California. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">This page contains several areas that could be
		controlled with mboxes. For example, the area offering a tour to first time
		visitors might not display if the visitor has been here before, or it might
		only be hidden if the visitor has not only been here before but has also taken
		the tour. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">If the visitor has been to the site before and has
		purchased children's clothing, the main image on the page might show a child
		instead of a woman, and the visitor might be invited to shop the selection of
		children's apparel rather than women's apparel. Likewise, the rest of the page
		might be changed to display other information that is useful for somebody who
		buys children's clothing. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">Some mboxes do not display anything. They might track
		a visitor's progress through your Web site, or might track whether the visitor
		completes a specific success metric, such as adding an item to the shopping
		cart or completing a purchase. One such type of mbox is a<i
		class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i "> conversion mbox.</i>
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">An mbox is the area where an 
		<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i "><xref
		  href="c_Offers.xml#concept_40CA4EEBF72C430395ADB96C3A3D7DF4" type="concept"
		  format="dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">offer</xref></i> is
		displayed. An offer is the actual content that is displayed in the mbox. When a
		particular offer displays is controlled by an 
		<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i "><xref
		  href="c_Experiences.xml#concept_B91F0F36E9F24AA58A3C6BC0A02871E8"
		  type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"
		  class="- topic/xref ">experience</xref></i>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Mboxes are used differently in Target Standard than in Target Classic.
		In Target Standard, an mbox is usually set up for the entire page, to track any
		user actions or to target offers to specific visitors. See the 
		<xref
		 href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/gs/#Simplified_Implementation"
		 format="http" scope="external">Target Standard Transition Guide</xref> for
		information about the differences in mbox implementation between Target
		Standard and Target Classic.
