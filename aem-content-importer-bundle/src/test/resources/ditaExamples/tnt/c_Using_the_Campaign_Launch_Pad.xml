		menu, based on campaign status, when the campaign went live, whether the
		campaign is in the trophy case, and the type of campaign. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The Campaigns Launch Pad contains a news feed that
		shows the latest account activities. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The Campaign area shows eight campaigns. By default,
		the campaigns that match the label criteria selected in the upper right
		display, sorted by their activation date. Most recently activated (approved)

      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Campaign Cards</b>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Campaign details are displayed on "cards." Each card

		you can make changes to the campaign. See

      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Add to Trophy Case</b> adds the campaign to
		the trophy case, where you can list the campaigns you find especially
		interesting. The trophy case is a filtered view of the Campaigns Launch pad
		that shows the campaigns that you've added. Select the 
		<uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol ">Campaign Trophy
		  Case</uicontrol> label from the Show menu to show your trophy case.

      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Interesting Segments</b>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">In addition to the campaign cards, the launch pad
		shows insights about your segments and your program overview. Interesting
		Segments show you when a specific segment in a campaign performs differently
		than the overall audience. This is determined the same way the "interesting"
		mark gets applied in the segment filter section of the campaign reports. The
		goal is to make it easier to see when your segments are performing differently
		than your overall audience and quickly exploit those changes through creating
		new targeted experiences. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Click 
		<uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol ">Create campaign</uicontrol>
		to create a new campaign built around the information gathered for the selected
		segment. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Click the link in the segment to load the campaign
		where the segment is performing differently. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Program Overview</b>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The Program Overview identifies several areas and
		tools that customers use to run their optimization program. The goal of the
		overview is to show which of these tools your team is using, and to offer
		information to learn more about each one. Keep in mind that some of these may
		not be applicable to your organization. This is intended to be used to
		"benchmark" your adoption of successful optimization strategies. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The metrics are based on usage in each of the focus
		areas. Increased usage in each area moves you along the optimization path from
		stage 1 to stage 3 in each area and in your overall status. The thresholds to
		reach each stage are based on the community's usage. About the top 30% of
		organizations are in stage 3, middle 40% are in stage 2, lower 30% are in stage
		1 and getting started. Contact your account representative if you have
		questions about your optimization level.
