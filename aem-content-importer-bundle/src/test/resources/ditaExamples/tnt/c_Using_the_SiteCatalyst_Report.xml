      <note>As of April 17, 2014, the information in this section has been
		  deprecated, and is replaced by the 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/a4t/" format="http" scope="external">Adobe Analytics as the Reporting Source for
			 Adobe Target</xref> functionality. Adobe is continuing to support the former
		  integration methods, but it is recommended that you use the new functionality.
		  There are some differences between the old and new integrations; you should
		  rely on the new report if there are any activities that use both (e.g. they use
		  the backend integration and the plug-in). We strongly suggest that you hide the
		  old report from your menus once you have upgraded to the new integration. You
		  should not need this report anymore, once all of your pre-existing activities
		  have run their course.

    <p class="- topic/p ">Initially, you're shown a report listing all
		campaigns. As in other reports, additional events and metrics may be added as
		columns and subrelations can be performed. By clicking into a campaign, you're
		taken to a report listing all experiences in that campaign.

    <p class="- topic/p ">You can breakdown by several subrelations, such as:

      <ul id="ul_576D4FA06AA445A2AA69248F8A528E3D" class="- topic/ul ">

		  Metrics

        <li id="li_10B6303ACD984202961B9FDD6080E485" class="- topic/li "> Traffic
		  Sources 
		</li>
        <li id="li_9461E3F734894997B326D56AA3BE4690" class="- topic/li ">
		  Products 
		</li>
        <li id="li_F79EB0B1436C414E9BFDE38173790322" class="- topic/li "> Visitor
		  Retention 
		</li>
        <li id="li_F9E45875C94342719B0E3F5D579C3D39" class="- topic/li "> Visitor
		  Profile

		  Conversion 
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">For example, a campaign named Home Page Banner Test
		has been subrelated with Monitor Resolutions. Looking at the data, a marketer
		might infer that although the Default experience generates more revenue
		overall, Experience D performs better for the 1024x768 monitor resolution
		segment. A marketer might use this insight to conduct further tests, and if
		validated, create a targeted campaign always showing Experience D to visitors
		with that screen resolution. Breaking down experience performance data by
		segment is possible as well, however the specific segments must be defined
		before the campaign is activated.
