  <shortdesc class="- topic/shortdesc "> Ideally, no business rules would be
	 applied to any automated decisioning campaign, to allow the modeling system to
	 determine the best options to show a visitor based on empirical evidence.

    <p class="- topic/p "> It is best practice to avoid business rules when
		questions of suitability arise. The system is designed to automatically select
		the optimal offer. Sometimes the results might be different than the marketing
		team's hypothesis, but this can result in valuable learnings that can drive
		decision making in other parts of the business. Whenever a business rule is
		applied to the campaign, that option is removed from being served, even if all
		the data indicates it is the best. This reduces the chance for the campaign to
		drive lift. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> As you can see in this example, business rules have
		reduced the model's options from four to two. This increases the chance that
		the model will serve a non-optimal offer because it is all that the model has
		available to it:

    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> It is not always possible to allow any content to be
		served to any person. Business rules fall into two categories: suitability and
		eligibility.

    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Use Case: Inappropriate offer
		  combinations</i>. If multiple mboxes, particularly on the same page, are used
		in one campaign, it might not make sense to show the same offer in both
		locations, or to show contradictory offers. Use experience exclusions to remove
		these combinations. However, these should only be used when it is absolutely
		required that the offers are not shown together. It is always better to let the
		model make the final decision than to enforce rules.

    <p class="- topic/p ">Ensure that the visitor is eligible to see the
		offers. Use offer targeting to deliver these business rules. On each serve
		decision, only the offers that the visitor matches the targeting rules for will
		be considered. No targeting on the offer means that every visitor is eligible
		for that offer.

		  Compliance issues 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">Use a business rule to ensure that visitors who
			 are ineligible for a product or offer to do not receive that content. For
			 example, rules about using the word "free" can vary by U.S. state. Use offer
			 targeting for these business rules.

		  Eligibility 
		  <p class="- topic/p "> If your customer already knows that a user owns
			 a particular product and that she cannot own two of them, then it is
			 appropriate to remove that offer from the set. Use the business rules to
			 determine eligibility, and let the model determine suitability. Use offer
			 targeting for these business rules.

			 into it. It cannot anticipate sharp changes caused by a new ad campaign, new
			 product announcements, or something in the news. Business rules can be used to
			 force these changes until the model can learn about them.
