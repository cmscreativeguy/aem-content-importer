    <p>Contact ClientCare or your Adobe consultant to extend the profile
		lifetime at no additional cost. The lifetime can be set to one of the
		following:
	 </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_DB4DB3517C6F4C3CBDA10CB749966771">
        <li id="li_C4726D027BFE461AB2E041338C3C1812">2 Weeks
		</li>
        <li id="li_11B11DE5C2CC47AC8AC4B777C65EF933">3 Weeks
		</li>
        <li id="li_23186FEA52AE464B8699DB3B41EF56C1">4 Weeks
		</li>
        <li id="li_AA1B153A6BAE43348131C41F4488906D">8 Weeks
		</li>
        <li id="li_C659FE6CE2814A97A5B3B164474135CE">12 Weeks
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If your profile is extended beyond the two-week default, you must
		download a new 
		<filepath>mbox.js</filepath> file after your consultant or ClientCare
		changes your settings. See 
		<xref href="t_Downloading_mboxjs.xml#task_B1A5E9CC0AAE48E38FA19686548B3371" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Download mbox.js?></xref>. The
		cookie extension to support the changed profile lifetime is included in the
		updated 
		<filepath>mbox.js</filepath> file.
	 </p>
    <p>The expiration date is not reset for existing profiles. If a previous
		visitor does not return for 15 days, that profile expires. If a previous
		visitor returns before the original two-week profile expires, the profile is
		reset to the extended lifetime. All new visitor profiles are set to the
		extended profile lifetime.
	 </p>
    <p>If you have two sites under one client code and a visitor visits both
		sites, the profile is set to the lifetime of profiles on whichever site was
		visited last. For example, if Site 1 has a 12-week profile lifetime and Site 2
		has a two-week lifetime, and the visitors visits Site 1 and then Site 2, that
		visitor's profile will expire in two weeks. If the visitor visits Site 1 after
		visiting Site 2, the profile will expire in 12 weeks.
