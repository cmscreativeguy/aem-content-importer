    <p>
      <note>As of April 17, 2014, the information in this section has been
		  deprecated, and is replaced by the 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/a4t/" format="http" scope="external">Adobe Analytics as the Reporting Source for
			 Adobe Target</xref> functionality. Adobe is continuing to support the former
		  integration methods, but it is recommended that you use the new functionality.
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>When targeting mbox parameters, the 20 most recent mbox parameters are
		displayed in the list. If the Analytics property you're trying to target
		doesn't appear (eg. eVar21), you can select 
		<uicontrol>choose a parameter</uicontrol> in the Site Pages targeting
		section and type the name of the parameter. Alternatively, you can target it
		explicitly with a profile script like: 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <codeph> eVar3IsTrue</codeph>
    </p>
    <p>
      <codeph>return mbox.name('SiteCatalyst: event') &amp;&amp;
		  mbox.param('eVar3') == 'true';</codeph>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Representing campaign conversion</b>
    </p>
    <p>All page variables, including events, eVars, and props, are accessible
		as mbox parameters associated with the 
		<codeph>SiteCatalyst:event</codeph> mbox. Associate Adobe Analytics
		events with campaign conversion by targeting on the 
		<codeph>events</codeph> mbox parameter associated with the 
		<codeph>SiteCatalyst:event</codeph> mbox. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Representing success metric conversion</b>
    </p>
    <p>The 
		<codeph>SiteCatalyst: event 
		</codeph>mbox can be used similarly to represent a visitor reaching a
		campaign success metric. Other variables can be used in addition to events. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Representing a segment</b>
    </p>
    <p>The 
		<codeph>SiteCatalyst: event 
		</codeph>mbox can be used similarly to represent a visitor being included
		in a segment. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Use for campaign or experience targeting</b>
    </p>
    <p>The 
		<codeph>SiteCatalyst: event</codeph> mbox can be used to target campaigns
		to visitors based on custom variables like eVars and s.props. For example, if
		eVar3 describes the registration state of a site visitor, you can target a
		campaign only to registered visitors<!-- as depicted in the image below-->.
		Note that mboxes on the page won't be associated with this targeted campaign
		until the next page load, because the visitor only qualifies for the campaign
		after the page has loaded. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Use to capture engagement</b>
    </p>
    <p>You can use the 
		<codeph>SiteCatalyst:event</codeph> mbox as an mbox to capture visitor
		engagement such as time on site or page views per visit. For information about
		capturing engagement, see 
		<xref href="c_Capturing_Engagement.xml#concept_DB31E18F26EA426EB7A87EAE16A477A5" type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Engagement?></xref>.
