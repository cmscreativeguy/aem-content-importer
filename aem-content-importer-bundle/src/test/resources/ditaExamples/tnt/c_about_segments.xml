    <p>Visitors who meet a specified set of criteria are part of a 
		<i>segment</i>. Campaigns can be targeted to specific segments. Only
		visitors who belong to that segment see the content of a campaign that is
		targeted to them. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, you might target a campaign to a segment made up of
		visitors who visit your page using a particular browser, or a mobile device
		that meets certain criteria, such as a certain device maker or a specific
		screen size. Your campaign might be targeted at visitors from one geographical
		region, or people who access your page from a certain social network. 
	 </p>
    <p>There are two kinds of segments:
	 </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_A47EE58A34E74818AFD84D78AA9E5846">
        <li id="li_C3A144F4712E4A7BA8B2BFD2AD20FE20">Reusable segments
		  <p>Reusable segments are created in the segment list, and can be
			 selected for any campaign. Changing one of these segments changes the segment
			 for all campaigns that use it. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_37405EF7E97845F18229BF933FE5A8ED">Custom segments 
		  <p>Custom segments (also known as 
			 <i>campaign-specific</i> segments) are specific to a campaign. They
			 are created as a part of the campaign and cannot be reused in other campaigns. 
		  </p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Segments define the target for your campaign and are used anywhere where
		targeting is available.
