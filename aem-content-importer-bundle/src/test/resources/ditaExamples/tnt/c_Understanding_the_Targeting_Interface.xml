					 scope="external" format="html">DeviceAtlas</xref>, a service of DotMobi.
					 DeviceAtlas is a comprehensive database of mobile devices built on data
					 compiled from numerous sources, including manufacturers and network operators.
					 This data is then verified, cross-referenced, and validated to build a large
					 and accurate mobile device database available.

				  <p> 
					 <draft-comment>Use the 
						<xref
						href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/tnt/1.3/sample/index.php"
						scope="external" format="html">Mobile Help Content Simulator</xref> to see what
						values match for different mobile devices. 
					 </draft-comment> "False" in the Device Atlas data set is
					 interpreted as 0. "True" is interpreted as 1. Use 0 and 1 when setting up
					 targeting. There is a value for each attribute for every device (0 if it is
					 false for that device). Therefore, 
					 <parmname>parameter is present</parmname> or 
					 <parmname>value is present</parmname> should not be used for
					 mobile device targeting. 
				  </p> 
				  <p>When configuring mobile targeting in a profile script, use the
					 following syntax: 
				  </p> 
				  <p> 
					 <codeph> .add("targeting.mobile.displayWidth", "displayWidth",
						NUMBER)</codeph> 
				  </p> 
				  <p> "displayWidth" is the name of the attribute you can use in
					 profile scripts. The value is a number. To use this, the value is 
					 <codeph>profile.mobile.displayWidth</codeph>. This is not
					 available directly for token replace in an offer; instead, it must first be set
					 as a profile script.

				  <p>Segment and target against the same populations you measure
					 against in other Marketing Cloud products (within the limitations of each

					 the populations included in each segment might vary slightly.

				  <p>(Requires Data Workbench and Analytics.) If enabled, Data
					 Workbench segment integration allows you to identify populations of your
					 visitors across channels via Insight and then push those segments to Target.
					 Once in Target, you can use those segments to deliver more meaningful campaigns
					 to those visitors with messaging that resonates better. 
				  </p> 
				  <p>A Data Workbench user can analyze populations within Data
					 Workbench for meaningful segments using all of the available data (including
					 off-line conversions through channels such as phone, a store, and so on). For
					 example, a visitor looks for shoes on your website. The visitor doesn’t convert
					 but downloads a coupon for 20% off their next purchase. The visitor then
					 purchases a shirt in your store. Data Workbench can be used to gather that data
					 then push profile data to Target showing that the visitor purchased a shirt off
					 line. You can then target a campaign offering a necktie to that visitor, when
					 normally Target might try to remarket shoes to that visitor.

		type="task" format="dita" scope="local">Setting Targeting Rules</xref> For

		type="task" format="dita" scope="local"> Targeting Based on Site Pages</xref>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>When a particular category is selected, you can apply one or more
		targeting conditions. For example, in the Geo category, define a rule like
		City=San Francisco. Adding multiple values creates an OR condition. The visitor
		only has to match one of the values to meet the targeting condition. For AND
		conditions on the same parameter, create a custom expression target, 
	 </p> 
	 <p>After you have created a rule, click 
		<uicontrol>Done</uicontrol>. A summary of the rule displays next to the
		targeting link for the level you are targeting. The following example shows the
		rule created above, at the Campaign level:

		<image id="image_8D09E58258AB4FDDA3E5F932E42E7E91"
		href="graphics/target_sent1.png"></image> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>You can further refine a rule by adding more conditions, or by creating
		additional rules in other categories. For example, to target only Firefox users
		from San Francisco who accessed your site from Google, set the Geo category to
		target users from San Francisco, the Visitor Behavior category to Firefox, and
		the Traffic Sources category to Google. All of the rules created across
		categories are combined with "AND." To create complex targeting rules that
		include "OR" operations across categories, create an expression target.
