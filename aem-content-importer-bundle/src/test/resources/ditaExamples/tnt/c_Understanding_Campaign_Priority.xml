		<note>This topic applies to Target Classic. If you are using Target
		  Standard, different priority rules apply, as explained in the

		<uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol "> List</uicontrol> to see
		which campaigns are using the mbox.

	 <p class="- topic/p ">Also, a notice on the Campaign Edit page shows how
		many other campaigns share a display mbox, useful for understanding which
		campaigns take priority. Click the notice for details, including the campaign
		name, priority, start date, and status.
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">The highest priority campaign wins control of an
		mbox. A low-priority campaign cedes control to the higher priority campaign. If
		two campaigns have the same priority, the campaign with campaign targeting is
		displayed. If both campaigns have targeting, the campaign that was targeted
		most recently has priority. Otherwise, the campaign created most recently wins
		control of the mbox. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">Even in cases where two campaigns share only one
		mbox, the higher priority campaign wins control of the mbox. For example:
		Campaign A is low priority. Campaign B is high priority. Campaign A and
		Campaign B share mbox3. A visitor enters Campaign A and for mbox 1 and mbox 2
		sees Campaign A's content. However, upon reaching mbox3, the visitor suddenly
		sees Campaign B content.

    <!--<p class="- topic/p ">
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Tip:</b> Set all campaigns to low priority.
		Set an exclusive targeting rule on the new pending campaigns to ensure only you
		can view the content. Example: URL Parameter testing=true. Once only you can
		view the content, make the pending campaign high priority for the QA period.

	 <p class="- topic/p ">If you have two activities, one targeting the branded
		search keyword Nike and the second targeting the non-branded keyword sneakers,

		higher priority, that content displays. Likewise, if the sneakers activity has
		the higher priority, its content displays. 
	 </p> 
	 <p class="- topic/p ">Since both activities have targeting, then the
		activity that was most recently viewed displays. If the visitor is new to the
		page, then the activity that was started most recently displays.
