	 of your campaigns so you can make decisions based on your data. Report data can
	 help you decide when to end a test, which campaign is the winner, and how to
	 get the most successful results from your site.

    <p class="- topic/p ">This section provides information about reports,
		including how to use reports, descriptions of the various report types, and
		information about reporting APIs.

    <p class="- topic/p ">Keep the following best practices in mind when
		working with reports.

      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Evaluate the metrics you defined as the key
		  metrics for the campaign.</b> It is important to focus on the metrics that you
		aimed to affect, not just every metric you can view. For example, your goal
		might be to improve the conversion rate, and the data shows that the average
		order value went down. That is an important thing to understand, but should not
		immediately mean that the test was a failure. Focus the next test in the series
		on raising the average order value. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Know when to stop your test and declare a
		  winner.</b> Before you can make a decision, reports need to reach statistical
		confidence and be stable over time. When you view the report with the main
		success metric or conversion that you specified when setting up your campaign,
		the lift column needs to show at least 90% confidence. When 90% confidence has
		been reached, go to the graph report and view the Cumulative Conversion Rate
		graph. Confirm that the winning experience has been winning for several days.
		You should run each test for at least two weeks and two weekends so a wide
		variety of visitors are included in the test analysis, not just the specific
		type of people who browse your site on, for example, Tuesday afternoons.
		Finally, make sure you view the report for each segment filter you defined, to
		understand if any segment is behaving differently than the general population. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Know what to do after you declare a
		  winner.</b> Pushing a winner creates a new campaign with only one experience
		and any targeting conditions required. After you approve this new campaign and
		deactivate the original test, the winning content displays to everyone on your
		site. If different experiences win for each segment, push each winner. The
		appropriate targeting is enabled to ensure that members of each segment see the
		winning content. Remember to deactivate the original test.
