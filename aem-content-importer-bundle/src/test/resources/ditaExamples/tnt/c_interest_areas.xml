  <title>Interest Areas</title>
  <shortdesc>Interest areas attempt to quantify the user behavior across
	 client's website (sometimes different domains) to determine what content or
	 site sections visitors are most interested in.

    <p>Automated decisioning and targeting algorithms base their prediction on
		variables that are stored in the user profile. A profile can contain two types
		of variables: continuous and nominal values. Thus, the quality of predicting
		the best offer (modeling group) to display relies heavily on the number and
		quality of data (variables) from the user profile. Currently, there are no
		systemic variables in user profile that would describe the user behavior on the
		site, as most of them are simple characteristics such as geo location or
		browser type.
	 </p>
    <p>The rationale behind tracking user activity on the website is related to
		the fact that different users have different intentions and interests when
		visiting a site. Because most of the clients' websites are very diverse and
		often one site comprises tens, if not hundreds of different compartments, users
		tend to focus their browsing on isolated areas. This tendency of visiting
		isolated areas of interest is often predictive of a user's temporary behavior.
	 </p>
    <p>The quantification of interest areas takes the form of one or more
		continuous variables stored and updated in the user profile on each request.
		Each variable represents the degree of interest the visitor expresses for a
		particular area of the site.
	 </p>
    <p> This information is often very predictive in determining what content
		is best to show. Site URLs are mapped to higher-level categories, or "interest
		areas" (for example, mapping men's product page viewing to a "men's" interest
		area), without need for manual updates or monitoring. Client sites are
		automatically crawled based on the domains that send mbox calls, and URLs are
		grouped based on the site's structure, as defined by the site's site map or
		general URL structure. Very common pages, like the home page, are removed from
		the interest area groupings. 
	 </p>
    <p>Interest areas are stored in the training data and, if they are
		predictive, affect the model and display in the insights report. This is all
		done automatically. No manual edits or updates to interest areas are needed.
