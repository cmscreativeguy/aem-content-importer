      <note>As of April 17, 2014, the information in this section has been
		  deprecated, and is replaced by the 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/a4t/" format="http" scope="external">Adobe Analytics as the Reporting Source for
			 Adobe Target</xref> functionality. Adobe is continuing to support the former
		  integration methods, but it is recommended that you use the new functionality.
		</note>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Variances of 15-20% are normal, even with similar
		data sets. Systems that count differently can result in much higher data
		variances, as much as 35-50%. In some cases, variances can be even higher. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Although actual data can vary significantly, trends
		are usually consistent. As long as the differences and trends remain
		consistent, the data remains valuable and useful. If the differences and trends
		are inconsistent, it could mean that something is set up incorrectly. In this
		case, contact your account representative for assistance. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Analytics uses a system based on visits and
		transactions, but Target uses visitor-based metrics. That means that whenever a
		visitor opens a page, it counts as a visit in Analytics, but Target does not
		count the visit until the conditions set in the campaign are met. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Reports in Target show performance based on the
		conversion mbox selected when defining the campaign, but this conversion mbox
		data is not sent to Analytics, which has its own conversion variables as
		defined by your Analytics tagging implementation. In cases where you may expect
		identical data (for example, if a retailer's order confirm page contains both a
		conversion mbox and an Analytics purchase event), data may differ due to the
		placement of these tags. In general, trends in the two products' reports should
		be the similar.

    <p class="- topic/p ">Expected data variances can be caused by both
		technical and business variances.
