  <title class="- topic/title ">Modeling Groups</title>
  <shortdesc class="- topic/shortdesc "> A modeling group is a set of offers
	 with similar marketing themes. Modeling Groups connect similar offers so the
	 models can be more efficient.

    <p class="- topic/p ">Offers are considered similar if they promote the
		same type of content. If you have multiple offers that highlight a specific
		product category but have different messaging or a different look and feel,
		place them in one modeling group. The model can determine generally which
		people like this product category quickly, and then make a finer decision about
		which version of that category content is best to show. Also, when a new
		creative or offer for that category is added to the campaign and the modeling
		group, the algorithm can immediately make smart decisions about that offer
		instead of starting from scratch.

    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <note class="- topic/note ">An offer can belong to only one modeling
		  group.

    <p class="- topic/p "> Modeling groups perform two functions.

        <li id="li_FBA2B0BA6ABF4396971BE0D9C37B09B9" class="- topic/li ">They
		  make the data richer. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">If two offers are very similar, then putting them
			 in a group allows the system to consider the two options as a single concept in
			 order to learn about the two options together. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_CAD6BD53F8A648A6BC8D40A51517F5E8" class="- topic/li ">Modeling
		  groups help accommodate changes to offers. 
		  <p class="- topic/p "> If Target modeled only at each offer level, then
			 whenever a new offer was added to a campaign the system would not know anything
			 about the new offer. But if the new offer is put into a group, then anything
			 already learned for that group is automatically applied to the new offer. As a
			 result, the system can respond to changes to the campaign without having to
			 relearn. 
		  </p></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">When new offers are added to the campaign, they
		immediately take on the generalized learning for the modeling group and start
		receiving targeted traffic. Multiple offers in the same modeling group are
		given the same model score, and targeted traffic is evenly distributed among
		them. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> Modeling groups are highly recommended because they
		improve the system performance. If an offer is not in a modeling group, the
		modeling system treats it as its individual modeling group. Also, default
		content is given its own modeling group. The default content option can also be
		removed from campaign. 
	 </p>
    <!-- <p>
		For each offer and modeling group, you can set a "value"
		  for the offer. This weighting is used to show the more valuable items more
		  often than the low value offers. 
		
	 </p>  -->
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <note class="- topic/note ">The goal of the automated decisioning
		  campaign is not to increase lift for every modeling group. Some modeling groups
		  may perform better than others.

        <li id="li_2A3F0C5842E847238B56F0288584B5E4" class="- topic/li "> Offers
		  should be grouped based on their "content theme" rather than their design.
		  Modeling groups should map to different products or offerings on your site,
		  rather than to design themes such as "people", "text-heavy" or "aspirational".
		  Each modeling group should map to an expected different behavior on the site. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_A44FC122F6A54A7D8679AB8CDF4BB188" class="- topic/li "> Use no
		  more than five to ten active modeling groups per campaign. With each modeling
		  group you add, the behaviors distinguishing one group from another become more
		  difficult as the similarity between the modeling groups increases. Sites with
		  high traffic might be able to support additional modeling groups.

        <li id="li_42DC2F6A39624F11BDA154FC1F23EF39" class="- topic/li "> How
		  long does it take for the model to learn about new modeling groups? 
		  <p class="- topic/p "> The system learns about the new modeling groups
			 when the model runs next (every six hours). Before the system builds a model
			 for new modeling groups, traffic is delivered randomly to these unknown
			 modeling groups. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_2E7CC3BD41654B999C0F200ECC8BE460" class="- topic/li ">Does the
		  historical data persist in the reports when a modeling group is deleted from
		  the campaign? 
		  <p class="- topic/p "> The offers still show in the reports, but the
			 modeling group association is lost. These offers are listed as "ungrouped
			 offers" in the modeling group report. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_925F3544A806406AA23C3AD2586AE89D" class="- topic/li "> When an
		  offer is removed from a modeling group but left in the campaign, does the model
		  have to relearn about that offer? What happens to the reports? 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">The model does relearn about the offer, because
			 the modeling decisions are made at the modeling group level. If the offer is
			 removed from a modeling group and not put into a new one, that offer is treated
			 as its own modeling group. The reports do not keep track of historical modeling
			 group associations at this time. Only the current modeling group is indicated. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_5C0A8E85F56D4FD18D1F037B5CD83DB7" class="- topic/li ">If a
		  modeling group or offer is not getting a lot of traffic, should I delete it?
		  When should I make that decision? 
		  <p class="- topic/p "> Generally, it is best to keep all of the options
			 in the campaign. While an offer or modeling group might not be getting a lot of
			 traffic, it might be highly predictive for a small set of visitors. The value
			 outweighs the cost of exploration for these offers, so it is recommended that
			 you leave all available offers. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_4DAA455D8C9F4178AB7D7810B079CE6E"> What happens if I rename an
		  existing modeling group? Does it merely change the name to the same modeling
		  group, or does it create a new modeling group and lose all the historical data
		  for that modeling group? 
		  <p> Changing the name doesn't do anything to the model, so your data is
			 safe. If you change the grouping itself (which offers are in which group), then
			 the traffic allocation going to each modeling group can change.
