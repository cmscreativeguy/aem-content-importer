      <title>Collection of IP Address</title>
      <p>The IP address of a visitor to a customer’s website is transmitted to
		  an Adobe Data Processing Center (DPC) where the IP address may be stored.
		  Depending on the network configuration for the visitor, the IP address does not
		  necessarily represent the IP address of the visitor’s computer. For example,
		  the IP address could be the external IP address of a Network Address
		  Translation (NAT) firewall, HTTP proxy, or Internet gateway.

      <title>Replacement of Last Octet of the IP Address</title>
      <p>Adobe has developed a new “privacy by design” setting that can be
		  enabled by Adobe ClientCare for Adobe Target. When this setting is enabled, the
		  last octet (the last portion) of the IP address is immediately hidden when the
		  IP address is collected by Adobe. This anonymization is performed prior to any
		  processing of the IP address, including before an optional geo-lookup of the IP
		  address. 
		</p>
      <p>When this feature is enabled, the IP address is made sufficiently
		  anonymous so it is no longer identifiable as personal information. As a result,
		  Adobe Target can be used in compliance with data privacy laws in countries that
		  do not permit the collection of personal information. Obtaining city-level
		  information will likely be significantly impacted by the obfuscation of the IP
		  address. Obtaining region- and country-level information should only be
		  slightly impacted.
		</p>
      <p>Contact Adobe ClientCare to enable the IP obfuscation feature.

      <title>GeoSegmentation</title>
      <p>If customers enable the replacement of the last octet of the IP
		  address, the remaining values of the IP address can be analyzed using reports
		  in Adobe Target. If the last octet of the IP address has not been obfuscated,
		  then the full IP address can be analyzed in Adobe Target. Customers can use the
		  GeoSegmentation feature that allows the customer to map out visitor location by
		  geographic area. GeoSegmentation data is granular only to the city level or zip
		  code level, and not to the individual level.
