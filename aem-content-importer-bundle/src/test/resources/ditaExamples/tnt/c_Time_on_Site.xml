  <title>Time on Site</title>
  <shortdesc>The Time on Site engagement type represents the time spent in the
	 visit (in seconds) from the point the visitor sees the campaign's first display
	 mbox to the load of the final page with an mbox in the session.

  <conbody>
    <p>The calculation does not include the amount of time spent on the last
		page. Pages between these actions do not need to contain mboxes or the 
		<filepath>mbox.js</filepath> file. 
	 </p>
    <p>The following example shows how time on site engagement is calculated in
		a campaign that tests two experiences, one with a cat image and one with a dog
		image.

    <p>
      <image id="image_3360CC6D9DD947FCA68FE24C3304D941" href="graphics/example_timeonsite.png"></image>
    </p>
    <p>During the first and second visits, visitors experience the cat
		experience for 90 and 80 seconds, an average of 85 seconds. On the third and
		fourth visits, visitors experience the dog experience for an average of 90
		seconds. 
	 </p>
    <p>If time on site is the KPI you're using to determine a winner, you'll
		need to decide whether the successful experience is the one with the highest or
		lowest time on site. For example, a high time on site might indicate that a
		creative on a video site holds visitor attention. But a high time on site for a
		support site might suggest a confusing creative that doesn't help visitors find
		what they're looking for. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note>Targeting a success metric capturing time on site engagement with
		  it will not impact the logged value. For example, if an online newspaper
		  targeted the success metric to pages in the sports section, the value would not
		  be limited to the time spent in the sports section of the site, but rather
		  would reflect the time of the entire session (after the visitor entered the
		  campaign).
