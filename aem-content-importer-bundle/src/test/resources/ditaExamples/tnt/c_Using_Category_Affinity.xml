  <title>Category Affinity</title> 
  <shortdesc>The category affinity feature automatically captures the
	 categories a user visits and calculates the user's affinity for the category so
	 it can be targeted and segmented on. This helps to ensure that content is
	 targeted to visitors who are most likely to act on that information.

  <conbody> 
	 <p>Whenever a user visits your site, profile parameters specific to the
		visitor are recorded in the Target database. This data is tied to the user's
		cookie. One particularly useful parameter is 
		<codeph>categoryId</codeph>, an 
		<xref
		 href="c_Mbox-Specific_Parameters.xml#concept_B81F2D77D34E4B4E84D23F5A5B4EDDED"
		 type="concept" format="dita" scope="local">mbox parameter</xref> assigned on a
		product page. As the visitor continues to browse, or returns for another
		session, the categories of products a particular user chooses to see can be
		recorded. You can also record category information by passing it as the mbox
		parameter 
		<codeph>user.categoryId</codeph> in any mbox (including a nested mbox),
		or as a URL parameter 
		<codeph>user.categoryId</codeph>. Please ask your account representative
		for more details. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Separate categories with a comma to create separate categories. For
		example: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_BCFA09B9A0834C6E8BEEE9A8302EDF0C"> 
		<li id="li_A91C3AEA450A45FC93AC2359D19FF493"> 
		  <codeph>categoryId=clothing,​shoes,​nike,​running,​shox,​nike shox
			 turbo,​nike shox turbo VI</codeph> 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_95F1601B0DB54E4AA4C12CD365FC18F5"> 
		  <codeph>entity.categoryId=clothing,​shoes,​nike,​running,​shox,​nike
			 shox turbo,​nike shox turbo VI</codeph> 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Based on the frequency and recency of visits to your product categories,
		the category affinity (if any) a user has is recorded. 
		<uicontrol>Category affinity</uicontrol> can be used to target
		populations for your campaigns. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>You can use 
		<codeph>user.categoryAffinities[]</codeph> in a profile script to return
		an array of the affinities that a visitor has populated. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Business case</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>A visitor's activity in one session, such as which category they visit
		the most often, can be used for targeting in subsequent visits. Each category
		page a visitor views during their session is captured, and their "favorite"
		category is calculated based on a recency and frequency model. Then, every time
		the visitor returns to the home page, the hero image area can be targeted to
		show content related to their favorite category. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Example of Using Category Affinity</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Suppose you sell musical instruments online and want to target sales
		promotions on bass guitars to visitors who have already expressed interest in
		guitars in the past. Using category affinity, you can create offers that
		display only to visitors with this category affinity. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><b>Algorithm</b>
	 </p>
	 <p>The category affinity algorithm works as follows:
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_52DE6F6984FE4671BAD52F762ED2E0BF"> 
		<li id="li_76E3265BA2CF4DF199543D495365FCDF">10 pts for first view
		</li> 
		<li id="li_47D93196079E49E1995D33C69F00085D">5 pts for every one after
		</li> 
		<li id="li_221EFDD57C9E48A88510CAC859CB7559">At end of session divide all
		  values by 2
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>For example, viewing categoryA then categoryB in one session results in
		A: 10, B: 5. When the session ends, you will have A: 5, B: 2.5. If you view the
		same items in the next session, the values change to A: 15 B: 7.5.
