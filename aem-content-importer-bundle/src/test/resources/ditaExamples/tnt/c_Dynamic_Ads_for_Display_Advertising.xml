    <p class="- topic/p ">Display Advertising is advertising that appears on
		paid media. Advertisers can purchase guaranteed inventory direct on publisher
		sites or non-guaranteed inventory via an Ad Network, Demand Side Platform (DSP)
		or a Supply Side Platform (SSP). The DSP or SSP delivers the ad across ad
		exchanges.

    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <note class="- topic/note ">There is a separate CPM fee for Display
		  Advertising impressions.

    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p "> You can continue to use the standard license for ad
		campaigns that do not run on paid media. For Display Advertising, your Account
		Manager enables a new campaign type called “Display Campaign” developed for
		this purpose.

          <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">1st party:</b> A publisher, such as the
		  New York Times, provides the placement for the ad. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_B5B081D9D1CE4DB596FC66A6F1A3E596" class="- topic/li ">
          <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">2nd party:</b> An advertiser, such as
		  Nike, who sponsors the ad campaign. 
		</li>

          <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">3rd party:</b> The advertiser’s media
		  agency. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_F7620DB2F24C4DEA82D60112A53E9963" class="- topic/li ">
          <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">3rd party tools:</b> The ad server and
		  possibly DSP (Demand Side Platform) that a media agency might use on behalf of
		  an advertiser. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_5D1CF514DBD54F6B91349E3AB6FC40C8" class="- topic/li ">
          <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">4th party and 4th party tools:</b> The
		  advertiser’s creative agency can deploy other vendors within an ad unit. For
		  example, a DoubleVerify pixel for Ad Safety, Quantcast for Audience
		  Measurement, Target for Dynamic Creative, Evidon for Ad Privacy, etc. 
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Use Case</b>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The marketer is allowed to configure dynamic ads
		using visitor information that is either collected on the advertiser site or
		across the Web (using a data provider). For visitor information collected on
		the advertiser site, dynamic ads provide retargeting on abandoned visits. For
		example, United Airlines shows you a discounted fare from San Francisco to Los
		Angeles after you abandoned that ticket configuration in their site's shopping
		cart. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The marketer can also configure dynamic ads using
		information that has been collected on the visitor as they browse the broader
		web. For example, United Airlines shows you an ad for a discounted fare from
		San Francisco to Los Angeles because you searched for those flights on Kayak.
		These are dynamic ads for acquisition purposes, because they drive net new
		traffic to your site. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Remarketing campaigns tend to suffer from volume.
		Consider an evolution to campaigns that have both acquisition and remarketing
		strategies working together. The tradeoff when incorporating a dynamic creative
		for acquisition campaigns is potentially purchasing data from vendors such as
		BlueKai, Rapleaf, Exalate etc. These vendors add data and processing cost to
		the mix. The data cost is a charge for using the 3rd party data. The processing
		cost is incurred when passing information to the universal profile maintained
		by Adobe.

    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Specifications for Creatives</b>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">You are free to use any creative size you like and
		are not limited to IAB specifications. Ad creatives can be built using three
		formats: 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <ul id="ul_FB499A661C9F436CA2C6CFB8D7DC3F47" class="- topic/ul ">
        <li id="li_47D6E07313584438AC569E2EC12DFD95" class="- topic/li "> Image 
		</li>
        <li id="li_A37E93DDAA20457EB48B452078A140CB" class="- topic/li "> HTML 
		</li>
        <li id="li_F9A4ADC55490482FBE50959515BAA18E" class="- topic/li "> Flash 
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">For example, you might prefer to use an HTML5 ad when
		the placement needs to include the iAd network that displays on iOS devices.
		Note that if the mobile browser does not support 3rd party cookies or the user
		has disabled 3rd party cookies, you cannot use the profile (server side cookie
		store) to target your advertising. If the target browser supports 3rd party
		cookies, the marketer is fully empowered to create dynamic ads using this
		profile. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Most creative shops want to use flash technology to
		create dynamic ads. The creative process for FLA-based dynamic ads involves
		instrumenting the creative for dynamic fields and then using a Display Campaign
		to configure the range of values for these ads.
