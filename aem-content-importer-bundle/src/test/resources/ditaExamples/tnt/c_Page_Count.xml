  <title>Page Count</title>
  <shortdesc>The Page Count engagement type measures the number of pages seen
	 in a visit from the point the visitor first sees the campaign's first display
	 mbox.

    <p>The following example shows how page count engagement is calculated in a
		campaign that tests two experiences, one with a cat image, and one with a dog
		image. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <image id="image_D5C9B75CAB0C4A58A1C512FEDBB85658" href="graphics/example_pagecount.png"></image>
    </p>
    <p>In this example, the first visitor experiences the cat experience.
		Assuming the marketer has captured page count engagement on a success metric
		associated with 
		<codeph>**any mbox**</codeph>, the page counter starts as soon as the
		display mbox around the cat image is seen. The second page is recorded as well,
		and as the visitor leaves the site, the value 2 is logged. 
	 </p>
    <p>Another visitor views four pages on the site and so the average number
		of pages for the cat experience is 3. 
	 </p>
    <p>Similarly, two visitors experience the dog experience and stay on the
		site for three pages and six pages respectively, for an average of 4.5 pages.
		The campaign receives enough visits so that one experience has, on average and
		with statistical significance, a higher pages per visit count than the others.
		Assuming the marketer is basing success on page count per visit, she will push
		the winning experience. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note>Only pages that make an mbox request are counted. Multiple mbox
		  requests on the same page are still counted as a single page. AJAX requests
		  (using 
		  <codeph>mboxUpdate</codeph>) are counted as separate pages. Adbox
		  requests are also counted as a page. 
		</note>
