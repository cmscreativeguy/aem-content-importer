      <p>Also prepare information related to the specific issue. For example,
		  one of the most common problems received by Client Care is that mboxes load too
		  slowly. For this issue, helpful data includes: 
		</p>
      <p>
        <ul id="ul_E353C7373DE7490DB6EA33B88254E27C">
          <li id="li_57D30F8A8413444EB27965A747175EBF">A Firebug trace showing
			 the repeatable slowness to a URL or host. 
			 <p>A gomez report with one or two outlying requests is not enough
				data to analyze or troubleshoot the issue. 
			 </p></li>
          <li id="li_D8261BD81DF141A7B7DDF28E3BC99A30">A screenshot of a
			 traceroute from the machine running the firebug TO 70.42.13.100. 
			 <p>This is very important. The EDGE networks are worldwide so it is
				very difficult to determine where the client is being sent. For example, if you
				can reproduce the issue from your desktop in your office, say "I can reproduce
				this from my desktop and I am homed to EDGE 20." 
			 </p></li>
          <li id="li_271F77B421E740F2A471EC38B8921DE8">Your client code and the
			 mbox name (if you have it). 
		  </li>
          <li id="li_3DCE72699B784D82BA0F993BCA6EB5BC">The number of mboxes
			 embedded in the page. 
			 <p>Is it a single mbox of many on the page that is slow? 
			 </p></li>
          <li id="li_1EAA5FC57E5B45C8B8AECCC1382A9BDB">How repeatable is the
			 slowness with the given mbox on the given page? 
			 <p>Providing a Firebug trace shows Client Care a one-time case
				scenario. If you can provide statistical data, such as "the lowest I've seen is
				300ms, highest I've seen is 1.1 seconds and I've tested 50 times," it will help
				to facilitate a solution. 
			 </p></li>
          <li id="li_D4D27093A2ED44A188F3BADEFB49A960">Information regarding
			 anything unusual about your campaigns. 
			 <p>Is there a high number of segments? (For example, do you update
				segments 3 to 4 times per hour in the admin interface?) This information helps
				Client Care understand the interaction between the admin interfaces and the
				edges for this campaign. Frequent updates to the campaign mean frequent reloads
				from the central server, which can force more remote calls or cache reloads. 
			 </p></li>
          <li id="li_4304B5ECB806464494D49F6E07B3B568">Any other data you think
			 might be helpful.
