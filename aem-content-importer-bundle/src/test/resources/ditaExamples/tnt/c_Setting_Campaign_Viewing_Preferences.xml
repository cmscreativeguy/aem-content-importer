  <title>Campaign Viewing Preferences</title>
  <shortdesc>When you create a new account, the hosts groups do not permit
	 anyone to view unapproved campaigns. You may override this for any host group,
	 except the default host group (usually the live production host). Only approved
	 campaigns may be viewed from the default host group.
