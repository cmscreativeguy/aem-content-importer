      <p class="- topic/p ">No, Target campaign and experience data behave like

      </p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">You can analyze the experiences explicitly defined
		  in the MVT campaign definition, but Analytics does not provide information
		  about best predicted experiences or element contribution. 
		</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">
        <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Can I analyze my Target-defined segments
			 in Analytics?</b>
      </p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">No, segments explicitly defined in your Target
		  campaign definition are not available in Analytics. Of course, you can break
		  down your campaign and experience traffic with Analytics variables.

      <p class="- topic/p ">
        <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Comparing my reports in Target and
			 Analytics, I notice that my conversion data differs for the same campaign.
			 Why?</b>
      </p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Reports in Target show performance based on the
		  conversion mbox selected when defining the campaign, but this conversion mbox
		  data is not sent to Adobe Analytics, which has its own conversion variables as
		  defined by your Analytics tagging implementation. In cases where you may expect
		  identical data (for example, if a retailer's order confirm page contains both a
		  conversion mbox and an Analytics purchase event), data may differ due to the
		  placement of these tags. In general, trends in the two products' reports should
		  be the similar. See 
		  <xref href="c_Understanding_Expected_Data_Variances.xml#concept_C624EC0C0BDE40A79546BE9D86F80C5D" type="concept" format="dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">Understanding
			 Expected Data Variances</xref> for more information.

      <p class="- topic/p ">
        <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Why is it that when I look at my page's
			 generated JavaScript, I see numbers with a format like "s_tnt=1323,1,0" instead
			 of my campaign and experience names?</b>
      </p>
      <p> Target serves the ids of the campaign and experience, rather than the
		  human-readable names. Iif you examine the special integration offer, you can
		  infer that 
		  <codeph>${campaign.id}</codeph> and 
		  <codeph>${campaign.recipe.id}</codeph> are replaced by the campaign and
		  experience ids, respectively. The traffic type is also included
		  (<codeph>${campaign.recipe.trafficType}</codeph>), but there's no need to pay
		  attention to that. Target assigns this data to a global variable named 
		  <codeph>s_tnt</codeph>, which the 
		  <filepath>s_code.js</filepath> later assigns to the 
		  <codeph>s.tnt</codeph> reporting variable before sending it along with
		  other data to the analytics reporting server. Behind the scenes, Target sends
		  classification files to analytics reporting, which perform the mapping. With
		  this strategy, changes to the campaign or experience name in Target are
		  automatically updated in analytics reports. 
		</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">
        <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">The integration with Analytics uses
			 something called a "tntvar." Is this variable available all the way through
			 into Analytics?</b>
      </p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">The tntvar is in the raw data warehouse files.
		  However, it is not available in the Analytics user interface. You can always
		  get at data in a data warehouse report, even if it is not available directly in
		  Analytics by using a VISTA rule to copy the value to an empty prop or eVar. The
		  "tntvar" contains raw data and is not available in reports, but other Target
		  reports are available (campaign, campaign &gt; recipe, recipe, etc.).
