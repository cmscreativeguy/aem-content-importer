			 labels you created are preserved and display in the Labels list. New system
			 labels include Live in 7 days, Live in 30 days, and Trophy case. See

			 This is determined the same way the "interesting" mark gets applied in the

			 to see when your segments are performing differently than your overall audience
			 and quickly exploit those changes through creating new targeted experiences.

			 glimpse at the progress of a campaign. It is designed to help you quickly see
			 how a campaign is doing so you can make decisions based on campaign data. The
			 Spotlight also enables you to compare the campaign objectives with the actual
			 results. The Spotlights provides a quick view into the winning experience and
			 an overview showing the performance of your success metrics, and can be shared

			 Campaigns Launch Pad. See

			 section of the Campaign Spotlight. You can download all snapshots for use in
			 reports or other records. See
