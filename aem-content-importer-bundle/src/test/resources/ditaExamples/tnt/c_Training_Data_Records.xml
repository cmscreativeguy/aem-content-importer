    <p class="- topic/p "> Each training data record contains a visitor
		profile, a snapshot of the profile when content was served, whether the visitor
		converted, and any revenue associated with the conversion. A model generalizes
		from all these specific instances of training records to predict the response
		probability of a previously unseen visitor to each of the content options in
		the campaign. Training data records are stored for both targeted and
		exploration content serves, which allows predictions to be made for anonymous
		and known visitors. For example, in a campaign with three offers, the model's
		job is to predict the probability that a visitor will convert on each of the
		three offers based on that visitor's similarities to previous visitors. If the
		modeling goal of the automated decisioning campaign is a revenue metric, then
		the model makes a value prediction rather than a binary conversion prediction.
		The marketer can determine the modeling goal for each campaign.

    <p class="- topic/p "> Many data points are stored per profile for the
		model builder. The profile variables fall into two categories: automatic and
		custom.
