  <title>Syncing Between Target Standard and Classic</title> 
  <shortdesc>Adobe Target Classic displays campaigns (activities) created in
	 Adobe Target Standard. Segments from Classic and audiences from Standard are
	 available in both interfaces.

  <conbody> 
	 <p>This syncing makes possible the functionality of Target Standard. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If you use both Standard and Classic, you will see the activities you
		create in Standard as read-only campaigns in the Campaigns list. This means you
		can view information about your activities, including reports, in the Classic
		interface, but you cannot make changes. The 
		<uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> button is disabled in Classic. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Syncing activities with Target Classic is required, even for clients
		whose contract does not include access to the Target Classic interface and
		functionality. If an activity does sync correctly after you create it, a
		message displays, and the activity cannot be used. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Reusable segments created in Classic are available as audiences in
		Standard. This means that audiences that cannot be created at this time in
		Standard can be created as a segment in Classic and used in Standard. For
		example, you can create a geo-targeted segment in Target Classic and use it in
		Target Standard, although you cannot edit the synchronized audience in the
		Standard interface. Likewise, audiences created in Standard are available in
		Classic.
