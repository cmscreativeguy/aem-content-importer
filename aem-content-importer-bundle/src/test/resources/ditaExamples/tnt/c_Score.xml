  <title class="- topic/title ">Capture Score</title>
  <shortdesc class="- topic/shortdesc ">The Capture Score engagement metric
	 calculates an aggregated score based on the value assigned to pages visited on
	 the site, from the point the visitor first sees the campaign's first display
	 mbox.

    <p class="- topic/p ">The following example shows how score engagement is
		calculated in a campaign that tests two experiences, one with a cat image, and
		one with a dog image. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <image id="image_7C3F8D18C89840198A5B9D8E0A3A88F8" href="graphics/example_score.png" placement="inline" class="- topic/image "></image>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">In this example, the first visitor experiences the
		cat experience. Assume that a global mbox passes in a page score based on the
		value of the page. If the marketer has captured page count engagement on a
		success metric associated with 
		<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">**any mbox**</codeph>, the visit
		score accumulates for any mbox request seen after the display mbox around the
		cat image. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The first page adds 1 to the score, the second page
		0.25, the third 0.10, and the fourth 0.10 for a total of 1.45. This could be
		interpreted as either currency or points. In a separate visit, a visitor
		experiences the Dog experience, and although the visitor views fewer pages, the
		score is 2.10, greater than the other visit, because the visitor viewed more
		valuable pages. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">You can take into account acquisition costs and
		affiliate link revenue by passing adboxes and redirectors, as depicted in the
		following page flow. Notice that, in this example, both mboxes on the article
		page pass a score, possibly representing a known CPM.

    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Assigning a Page Score</b>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">You can assign a value to any page on your site based
		on what the page is worth to you. For example, a cooking site might be able to
		sell ads for more money on their feature article pages than in their experience
		section. Thus, the feature articles are more valuable than the experience
		section. Page score allows you to develop an overall "value" of a visit, so the
		person who reads more feature articles gets more "points" than someone who just
		browses the experiences. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">There are two methods to assign a score to a page: 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <ul id="ul_C4BB8CCCDFCA4CE78EB84F4574ACE23B" class="- topic/ul ">
        <li id="li_42CCCB06130D4EB3918D5FF33B885C7D" class="- topic/li "> In the
		  mbox code, create an mbox parameter called 
		  <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mboxPageValue</codeph>. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">Example: 
			 <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">('global_mbox',
				'mboxPageValue=10');</codeph></p><p class="- topic/p ">The specified value is added to the score every
			 time the page with that mbox is viewed. If multiple mboxes on the page include
			 score values, the score for the page is the total of all mbox values. 
			 <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mboxPageValue</codeph> is a
			 reserved parameter used for passing values in an mbox to capture an engagement
			 score. Positive and negative values can be passed. The sum is calculated at the
			 end of each visitor's visit to calculate the total score for the visit. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_C384602AF2DE4E20B424E5F517120083" class="- topic/li "> Pass
		  the 
		  <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">?mboxPageValue=n</codeph>
		  parameter in the URL for the page. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">Example: 
			 <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">http://www.mydomain.com?mboxPageValue=5</codeph></p><p class="- topic/p ">Using this method, the specified value is added
			 to the score for each mbox on the page. For example, if you pass the parameter 
			 <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">?mboxPageValue=10 
			 </codeph>and there are three mboxes on the page, the score for the
			 page is 30. 
		  </p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <note class="- topic/note ">Mboxes located above the campaign's first
		  display mbox will not be included in the score. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">Best practice is to assign values in the mbox code.
		This allows you to be precise in the values you measure, depending on the
		content of each mbox. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <note class="- topic/note ">For easier maintenance, you can configure
		  your site's page score value assignments in the 
		  <filepath class="+ topic/ph sw-d/filepath ">mbox.js</filepath> file
		  with some conditional JavaScript logic. This eliminates the need to add more
		  code to your pages. Contact your account consultant for assistance. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">You can combine the two methods, but this might
		result in a higher score than expected. For example, if you assign a value of
		10 to each of three mboxes and no score to a fourth mbox, then pass the URL
		parameter 
		<codeph>?mboxPageValue=5</codeph>, your page score will be 50, 30 for the
		three mboxes with assigned values, and then 5 for each of the four mboxes on
		the page. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">The counter starts with the first display mbox, not
		the entry mbox. For example, if you enter the campaign on the homepage which
		doesn't have a display mbox, then link to catalog page containing a display
		mbox, the counter begins when you move to the catalog page. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">You can also pass in negative values on certain pages
		that cost you money or are not good for a visitor to see. The negative values
		affect the overall score as well. This technique can be used on a page that
		visitors reach from an advertisement, so you know how much the CPC was. Or, for
		example, it can be used for a support or contact page, where you know that
		visitors might call or request assistance from this page.
