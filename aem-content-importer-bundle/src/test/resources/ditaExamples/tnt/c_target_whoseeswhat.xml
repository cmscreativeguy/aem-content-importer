  <title>How Target Decides Who Sees What Content</title>
  <shortdesc>Target uses the criteria you set up for your campaign to determine
	 who sees what content, based on a specific order of operations.

    <p> Target does not automatically split traffic if you have two experiences
		with the same rules-based targeting. If the visitor qualifies for Experience B
		and Experience C based on the targeting, then 100% of those users go into the
		first experience (in this case, Experience B). 
	 </p>
    <p> The same is true for experiences with no targeting. In the following
		example, if the user does not qualify for A or B, then they are always placed
		into Experience C (in other words, no one will make it to Experience D):

      <ul id="ul_87E27B4248CB48E59F5837ED7E2C8B97">
        <li id="li_E6E1CAE7ECD2428BAD6E7696502C33D3">
          <p>Experience A - 10% of visitors 
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li id="li_F1C9A19E0BEB412DA13220A0B523AA35">
          <p>Experience B - Only show Fri/Sat/Sun 
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li id="li_732F139AF04B4835955E9574F5DFC316">
          <p>Experience C - (not targeting) 
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li id="li_A9B63A22E746450DB3153E8F1B5848DC">
          <p>Experience D - (not targeting) 
		  </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> One way around this is to create a profile script that generates a
		random number from 1...100 and then set up the targeting this way: 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_8EA81422B51E483AB6607CEE76678A44">
        <li id="li_D3437CCD412447459E8182AB700AA87B">
          <p>Experience A - 10% of visitors 
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li id="li_467FE6343C574DA1AC2CD1FCE089F126">
          <p>Experience B - Only show Fri/Sat/Sun 
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li id="li_CFEB6F4306854A30BD6D1F9341B317FC">
          <p>Experience C - (random number profile has value 1..50) 
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li id="li_0B7D5211F60944AA8C28B869C825FE95">
          <p>Experience D - (random number profile has value 51..100) 
		  </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> You can add percentage targetingto Experience C (set Experience C to
		50% of traffic and leave Experience D without any targeting) to make sure
		visitors get into all experiences. 
	 </p>
    <p>If your campaign has multiple experiences that are set up with specific
		percentage targets, for example four experiences each configured to receive 25%
		of the traffic, a random number is generated and that number determines the
		experience shown to a visitor. In this example, if the random number is 30, the
		visitor would receive the second experience because 30 is between 25 and 50,
		the second range when dividing 100 into 25% chunks. 
	 </p>
    <p>If percentages are not specified, a random starting experience is chosen
		for each 
		<xref href="c_edge_network.xml#concept_0AE2ED8E9DE64288A8B30FCBF1040934" format="dita" scope="local">Edge node</xref>. For example, if there are three
		experiences and the second is randomly chosen, the first visitor sees the
		second experience. Each subsequent visitor sees the next experience, in
		rotation. So, the second visitor on that Edge node sees the third experience,
		the third visitor sees the first experience, the fourth see the second
		experience, and so on.
