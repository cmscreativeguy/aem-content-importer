  <title>Percentage Targeting</title>
  <shortdesc>You can set up your campaign so a specified percentage of visitors
	 sees each experience.

    <p> For example, you might have three experiences, and set them up so 50%
		of visitors see Experience A while 25% of visitors see Experience B and another
		25% see Experience C. 
	 </p>
    <p>When a visitor enters the campaign, a random number is generated. That
		number is used to choose the experience to display. If there has been very
		little traffic, for example at the beginning of a campaign, the traffic might
		not be split exactly as specified in the percentages. The more traffic you get,
		the more exact the percentages will become. 
	 </p>
    <p>If percentages are not specified, a random starting experience is chosen
		for each 
		<xref href="c_edge_network.xml#concept_0AE2ED8E9DE64288A8B30FCBF1040934" format="dita" scope="local">Edge node</xref>. For example, if there are three
		experiences and the second is randomly chosen, the first visitor sees the
		second experience. Each subsequent visitor sees the next experience, in
		rotation. So, the second visitor on that Edge node sees the third experience,
		the third visitor sees the first experience, the fourth see the second
		experience, and so on. 
	 </p>
    <p>The total of the percentages for the campaign should add up to 100%.
