		  filters</xref> instead of targeting. 
	 </p>
    <p>When a visitor lands on a page where you have set up a campaign, Target
		determines whether the visitor qualifies as a member of an audience that has
		been identified for the test. If the visitor cannot be identified as a member
		of a target segment, that visitor is shown default content and is not included
		in the reports for the campaign. 
	 </p>
    <p>If the user is identified as part of a target audience, then Target
		determines which experience to display, based on the criteria established when
		the campaign was created. 
	 </p>
    <p> In most cases, it is better to analyze visits than visitors. If you use
		visits, you get a more narrow view than you would with visitors, because
		everything happens within one session. With visitors, you are including
		people's actions who entered or originally saw the test content before the
		current session and are only acting now. Viewing by visitor is important in
		cases where you hypothesize that the changes will have longer-term impact on a
		user's behavior, or if it typically takes your customers multiple visits to
		convert.
