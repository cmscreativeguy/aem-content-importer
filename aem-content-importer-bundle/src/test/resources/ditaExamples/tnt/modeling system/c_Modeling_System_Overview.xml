  <title class="- topic/title ">Modeling System Overview</title> 
  <shortdesc class="- topic/shortdesc "> Models are computer algorithms
	 developed to automatically predict behavior of a new site visitor based on
	 activity from earlier visitors. The model maximizes the optimization goal
	 defined per campaign.

  <conbody class="- topic/body  concept/conbody ">
	 <p class="- topic/p "> Models are built using historical training data
		about visitors and their response to content. The model determines which
		variables and values predict behavior in the campaign. The model scorer matches
		each new visitor, against the predictive variables in the model, and determines
		a score for each content option in the campaign. Simultaneously, real-time
		response tracking monitors responses based on the predictive variables and
		determines updated probabilities, which are then inputted into the scorer to
		calculate response rates for new visits.
	 </p>
	 <p class="- topic/p "> Models are built every six hours, using between
		seven and 84 days worth of historical data, as defined by the truncation
		window, to allow the model to adjust to changing customer behavior over time.
		The system validates the model to confirm it accurately predicts behavior. The
		model is used by the campaign for the next six hours to deliver the best
		content option to each visitor.
