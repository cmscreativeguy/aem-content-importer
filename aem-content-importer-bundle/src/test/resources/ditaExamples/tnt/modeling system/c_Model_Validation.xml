	  class="- topic/section "> This validation step ensures that the new model does
		not overfit to the training data. To ensure that the model is indeed predictive
		of new, unseen traffic, instead of simply describing what happened before, the
		model is tested. First, the raw training data traffic is split into two
		sections. Most goes into building the model, and the model runs against the
		rest of the raw traffic. 1:1 measures the correlation between the actual
		response values from the test group against the model's scores for those
		records. The new model must pass certain thresholds to become the new model for
		the campaign.
