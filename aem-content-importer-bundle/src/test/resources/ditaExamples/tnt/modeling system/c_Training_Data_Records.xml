	 <p class="- topic/p "> Each training data record contains a visitor
		profile, a snapshot of the profile when content was served, whether the visitor
		converted, and any revenue associated with the conversion. A 1:1 model
		generalizes from all these specific instances of training records to predict
		the response probability of a previously unseen visitor to each of the content
		options in the campaign. Training data records are stored for both targeted and
		exploration content serves, which allows predictions to be made for anonymous
		and known visitors. For example, in a campaign with three offers, the model's
		job is to predict the probability that a visitor will convert on each of the
		three offers based on that visitor's similarities to previous visitors. If the
		modeling goal of the 1:1 campaign is a revenue metric, then the model makes a
		value prediction rather than a binary conversion prediction. The marketer can
		determine the modeling goal for each campaign.

	 <p class="- topic/p "> Many data points are stored per profile for the 1:1
		model builder. The profile variables fall into two categories: automatic and
		custom.
