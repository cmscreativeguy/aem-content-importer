		changes in response rates and modify its responses within those six-hour
		windows. Quick changes like news announcements about interest rates, sales,
		television advertisements, and other things can almost instantly affect the
		traffic to a 1:1 campaign. The campaign accounts for this by tracking the
		response rate for each campaign option compared to the prediction from the
		model. The real-time response rate then influences the model score. This means
		that, for example, a content option with a high model score but a lower
		real-time response rate has less chance of being selected than if the system
		only used the model score.
