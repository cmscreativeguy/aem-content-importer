  <shortdesc class="- topic/shortdesc "> Custom profile variables in
	 Test&amp;Target are used by the 1:1 modeling system to offer a crucial way to
	 provide additional data points beyond what the modeling system can determine
	 from the page request. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody class="- topic/body  concept/conbody ">
	 <p class="- topic/p ">Any profile attribute passed from an mbox or created
		in the profile attributes page is automatically included in the 1:1 training
		data records. Data passed in via the third-party profile API and via mbox
		parameters from 1:1 display mboxes also contribute to the training data.
		Segments added to 1:1 campaigns contribute to the training data for that
		campaign. These methods allow marketers to add data into the system from
		offline sources, order management systems, and CRM systems.
	 </p>
	 <p class="- topic/p "> Marketers can also have a valuable impact on the
		modeling system by grouping data that the system would otherwise not view as a
		set. If there are value sets for variables or sets of variables that are known
		to be valuable for a business, either through offline analysis, data warehouse
		data, or direct marketing analysis, then these groupings should be saved as
		profile attributes in Test&amp;Target. These sets can provide valuable
		information to the model that the model would not collect itself. For example,
		if a marketing organization considers "luxury loyalists" as people who have
		purchased more than five times and spent a total of $5,000, then grouping those
		two data points into a profile attribute or segment means the modeling system
		considers those two data points as a combined attribute.
