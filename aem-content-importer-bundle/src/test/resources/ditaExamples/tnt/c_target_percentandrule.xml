  <title>Combined Rules-Based and Percentage Targeting</title>
  <shortdesc>You can combine percentage-based and rules-based targeting.

    <p>For example, you might want to show a particular offer to 60 percent of
		visitors from California. When using the two targeting styles together, the
		rule is considered first, then the percentage. In this example, all California
		visitors are sampled first, then 60% of those visitors see the specified
		content. 
	 </p>
    <p>You might want to test within mutually exclusive groups, such as new or
		returning visitors, or purchasers vs. non-purchasers. And, you might want to
		show 30% of your new users one set of content. Or you might want 75% of
		non-purchasers to view a particular offer that you only want to show to 25% of
		purchasers. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, you might create a campaign with four experiences that you
		want to target as follows:

      <ul id="ul_E68A3688CE8D48C1A5247F4EF9A6897F">
        <li id="li_AF62AECDC9BB48D5942CB903288B17B7"> Experience A: Targeted to
		  20% of male visitors 
		</li>
        <li id="li_CBB800333CA946FFA1FB4889B7C7B59D">Experience B: Targeted to
		  80% of male visitors 
		</li>
        <li id="li_02C64A796FA946B1BF8E435EA008E5F5">Experience C: Targeted to
		  10% of female visitors 
		</li>
        <li id="li_1A58520EF48A485E932129CDF9417C1D">Experience D: Targeted to
		  90% of female visitors 
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> In this example, the segments 
		<varname>Male</varname> or 
		<varname>Female</varname> are determined first, then the segments are
		divided according to the specified percentages.
