      <b>Strong cohesion areas vs. Site coverage 
		</b>
    </p>
    <p>A website should be divided into meaningful quality areas with a decent
		coverage. If the areas of the site are not meaningful, the variable becomes
		non-predictable. The main risk is to gather too many notions under one area.
		This could happen either because the URLs that an area contains are not highly
		related to each other, or because there are too many URLs and, therefore, it is
		not possible to find a common characteristic. A typical site can have several
		thousands to several millions of pages and sometimes there are several domains.
		so there should be enough areas to provide a good coverage across all pages.
		The tradeoff is between having small, predictive areas and having large areas
		that cover most pages, but are not very predictable. The issue with small areas
		is that they do not cover the entire site, and provide good particular details
		only for a fraction of users.

      <b>Scalability vs Predictability 
		</b>
    </p>
    <p>Because each user is targeted individually, data should be collected
		from millions of users and be leveraged for a decision in milliseconds. The
		setup should scale linearly because the user base is always growing. The
		tradeoff is between the amount of data stored per profile (memory footprint)
		and the quality of prediction, which depends on the amount of data available.
