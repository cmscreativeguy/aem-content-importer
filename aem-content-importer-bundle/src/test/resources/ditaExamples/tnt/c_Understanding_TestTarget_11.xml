    <p class="- topic/p ">Adobe Target automated decisioning and targeting
		records visitor activity on the site, building up a profile of each individual
		visitor. It tracks responses to content, both for individuals and the
		population as a whole, then uses sophisticated modeling approaches to
		automatically target each individual by accounting for everything known about
		that visitor.

    <p class="- topic/p ">Automated decisioning learns by itself and requires

		  Generalized Learning 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">The system learns what is most popular for the
			 population as a whole, and watches for time variation. Response rates to
			 content are measured to provide sufficiently accurate assessments of content
			 performance. Sometimes less popular content is deliberately served to explore
			 visitor response.

		  Targeting 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">The system builds models and automatically learns
			 what products an individual visitor is most likely to be interested in. Every
			 time a visitor interacts with the site, information is collected and stored in
			 the visitor profile. 
		  </p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">To maximize generalized lift, the popularity of
		different content over the whole population is measured, exploration is
		carefully managed, and changes in performance over time are accounted for. Thus
		maximizes performance for new visitors, or visitors about whom little is known.
		Generalized learning also takes into account market movements, such as TV
		advertising campaigns, changing interest rates, and so on. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">To maximize targeted lift, comprehensive real-time
		visitor profiles are tracked and multivariate models are built to understand
		user propensity. This maximizes relevance for those users for whom
		comprehensive knowledge has been compiled. Creatives are grouped by theme so
		they can be mapped to products or marketing messages. The visitor profile is
		used to build multivariate models that predict how well each visitor is likely
		to respond to a particular offer. Many

		automatically extracts predictive information from the data. If a variable has
		no predictive power, it is ignored. The system collects and manages the data
		without the need for human interaction.
