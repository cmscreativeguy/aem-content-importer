    <p class="- topic/p ">Use segment filters to specify the segments used for
		reporting. You can select a segment and compare its performance to the overall
		traffic. you might want to understand whether your winners were different for
		the different traffic sources, when compared to general traffic. This helps you
		discover segments that should be potentially targeted to different creative.
		One winner does not fit all traffic in many cases. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">For example, visitors who arrive at your page from a
		certain search engine might be one segment. Other segments might be based on
		gender, age, location, registration status, purchase history, or just about any
		other detail you can collect about your visitors. Use segment filters to divide
		visitor traffic, and compare experience performance for each traffic segment. 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">When planning to use segment filters for a campaign,
		consider the following guidelines: 
	 </p>
    <p class="- topic/p ">
      <ul id="ul_E366959CF30B45ED8FFA0747EE12DF79" class="- topic/ul ">
        <li id="li_CE074F177CDC4B65989436C44329B28B" class="- topic/li ">
		  Visitors can be in multiple segments. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">If there are two segments set up (for example,
			 "new visitors" and "visitors from Google"), and a person meets both criteria,
			 then they are counted and tracked in both segments. As a result, the sum of the
			 visitors in the segments does not match the number of visitors in a campaign. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_1341C70F84214DB5B3A138C3FA41197D" class="- topic/li "> Set up
		  segments before launching the campaign. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">Segment data cannot be retrieved retroactively.
			 If you do not configure segment filters before you start the campaign, then
			 decide to use them after the campaign has run for a while, you will not collect
			 the data for the time that has already passed. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_C5A9B80A1E394AF3BB26039AE0A719D1" class="- topic/li "> Begin
		  with two to four segments. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">Focus on basic information, such as the traffic
			 source. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_FA10E286A97F4ED28FB54662059359E8" class="- topic/li "> Rename
		  segments as needed. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">You can rename a segment without affecting the
			 data to make the segment name more meaningful for the results being collected,
			 even if the campaign is active. 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_841B4237013D4C478FDEA9BD9ADB2890" class="- topic/li "> Enter
		  precise values. 
		  <p class="- topic/p ">Segment filter values are case-sensitive. For
			 example, if you are using a segment that filters on cities, you should use an
			 "OR" condition to include possible spelling and capitalization variations, such
			 as "Vienna," "vienna," "wien," and "Wien." 
		  </p></li>
        <li id="li_32092EF3559F4AD8A47B933729EBBE87">Segments created from the
		  Segments list are reusable. 
		  <p>Segments created as part of a campaign cannot be reused.
