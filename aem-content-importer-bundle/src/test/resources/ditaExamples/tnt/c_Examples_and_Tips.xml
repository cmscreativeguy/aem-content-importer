          <p class="- topic/p ">If a month has gone by since a shopper bought a

          <p class="- topic/p ">If user intent is demonstrated by action, then
			 repeated action increases confidence in that intent. So why not deliver a
			 different offer to a visitor who has purchased five times rather than once? You
			 can also gain insight by measuring the frequency of certain clicks. For
			 example, clicking repeatedly into a high-heeled shoe category provides
			 information about a user's gender, valuable for targeted content.
