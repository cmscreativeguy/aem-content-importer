  <title>Structure of Interest Areas</title>
  <shortdesc>An interest area is a part of the website, or more specifically,
	 several URLs from the total of all the pages. The URLs are gathered in such a
	 manner that they are highly related to each other, usually gravitating around
	 one notion or topic.

    <p>There are two constituents of an interest area:
	 </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_29BF12AD8D9D45A0B3A3A73BB10D1AB4">
        <li id="li_281BFE6899EC43199E3859629C8A70F4">The list of URLs
		</li>
        <li id="li_7EC30BCC4148451989232D144C280187">The topic which unites the
		  URLs expressed by the interest area name
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For example, a computer manufacturer might have the following interest
		area:
	 </p>
    <p>name (topic): Laptops URLs:
	 </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_A14BEE618D97444AA77D81573E53AFC7">
        <li id="li_0D9A04B2173F4E658DD9E67051206FFD">
          <p> http://www.computercorp.com/us/computers.aspx
		  </p>
        </li>
        <li id="li_E2747B6B78C2417488999B7F3E536758">
          <p> http://www.computergamingcorp.com/laptops.aspx 
		  </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Notice that there are two domains: computercorp.com and
		computergamingcorp.com. In this case, an interest area is not just a site
		compartment, because the topic can transcend several sites of the same client.
		This cross-gathering is necessary because a user who seldom visits
		computercorp.com, but is intensively browsing computergamingcorp.com laptop
		related pages, will likely be more interested in laptops than desktops when she
		visits the computercorp.com site.
	 </p>
    <p>The structure of an interest area is absolved of any logic regarding how
		it was constructed or of the manner it is going to be used for generating model
		variables. This completely separates the logic of discovering (constructing)
		the interest areas and the one of computing variables.
	 </p>
    <p>Additionally, for performance reasons (due to memory constraints), a
		hash value is generated for each URL. The hash takes the form of an 8-byte java
		long value.
