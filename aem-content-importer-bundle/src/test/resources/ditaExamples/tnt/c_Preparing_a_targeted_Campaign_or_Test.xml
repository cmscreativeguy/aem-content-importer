      <title>Experience-Level Target</title>
      <p> Target at the experience level to determine who sees the experience
		  of the people who are already allowed into the campaign. By default, Target
		  performs randomization so each experience is shown an equal number of times
		  across all visitors to the campaign. Experience-level targeting overrides this
		  default randomization, because you are applying criteria that define who is
		  allowed to see any given experience.
		</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Experience-level targeting is typically used with a
		  landing page 
		  <xref href="t_Creating_a_Landing_Page_Campaign.xml#task_1B12DDB4D4E64EF8B47113DFBE1EF0BC" type="task" format="dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">Landing Page
			 campaign</xref>. With targeting rules on each experience, you can show relevant
		  content to different groups in the same mbox on your site. For example, you
		  might want to "welcome" visitors from each of your affiliates. You can set up a
		  landing page campaign that shows a different welcome message in an mbox based
		  on which affiliate a visitor reached your site from. This can all be managed in
		  one campaign. As your list of affiliates change, you can remove or add new
		  experiences targeted to that affiliate source (using the Traffic Sources
		  category) and choose an offer for each experience that uses that affiliate's
		  logo or special offer. 
		</p>
      <p class="- topic/p "> You can also choose to target a percentage of your
		  traffic to an experience. At the experience level, click on the population
		  target icon. An option to choose percentage appears. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <note>For an A/B test, there is only one chance to enter the campaign.
			 If a visitor is included in the 50% that gets into the campaign, that visitor
			 is in the campaign. If the visitor is not included, that visitor is not
			 evaluated for the campaign again. For a landing page campaign, the percent
			 evaluation happens for every session instead of once per cookie life. 
		  </note>
      </p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Targeting experiences to specific visitor segments
		  overrides the default randomization which shows each experience an equal number
		  of times. 
		</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">
        <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Tip:</b> It is recommended that, if you
		  want to change percentages or greatly affect the flow of people into each
		  experience, you should create or copy a new campaign. Otherwise, if you change
		  the percentages on different experiences, it will take a few days for the data
		  to normalize again if many purchasers are return visitors. For example, if your
		  A/B test is split 50/50, and then you change the split to 80/20, for the first
		  few days after that change, the results might look skewed. If the average time
		  to conversion is high, meaning it takes someone several hours or even days to
		  make a purchase, then these delayed conversions can affect the reports. So, in
		  that first experience where the number went from 50 to 80, and the average time
		  to conversion is two days, only people from the 50% of the population are
		  converting on the first day of the test, although today 80% of the population
		  is entering the experience. This makes it look like the conversion rate
		  plummeted, but it will normalize again after these 80% of people have the two
		  days to convert.

    <section id="section_B1E8CCF14F5E4E69AA71D70D295DBAC9">
      <title>Location/Mbox-Level Target</title>
      <p>Target at the mbox level to determine whether to show specific content
		  to visitors who are allowed into the campaign and who get to see this
		  experience. If the visitor does not meet the targeting conditions for a given
		  mbox, default content is shown. 
		</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Mbox-level targeting gives you the ability to show
		  content in an mbox only when the visitor meets certain real-time conditions.
		  This is most often used when an mbox is on every page of a site (the logo for
		  example) or on a templated page like a category or product page. You can
		  uniquely identify specific instances of those mboxes (one instance of an mbox
		  on a template page, or one instance of the global mbox) so that you can display
		  specific content in it. For example, if you wanted to promote a special offer
		  on all women's products but not on any men's products, you would either need a
		  specially named mbox on the women's pages, or you can use mbox-level targeting
		  to limit when the content in the campaign actually displays. For example, if
		  the women's pages all share the same URL structure, you could target on the
		  word "women" existing in the current page URL. 
		</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Mbox-level targeting is checked first. In other
		  words, a visitor must match the mbox-level targeting before being considered to
		  see a display mbox, and therefore be eligible for the campaign. 
		</p>
      <p>When you target at the mbox level, targeting criteria is evaluated
		  each time the mbox is requested. So, if a visitor navigates to category 1, 5,
		  and 20, in that order, the visitor would see content for category 1, the
		  special offer for category 5, and then the default content for category 20.
		  Browsing to category 5, enters the visitor into the campaign, so even if
		  default content is displayed for category 20 next, the visitor is still in this
		  campaign.
		</p>
      <p>Targeting at the mbox level is not used nearly as often as targeting
		  at the campaign or experience level, but is useful for situations in which you
		  want to ensure that certain visitors continue to see content that makes sense,
		  in the context of global mboxes.
		</p>
      <p>
        <note>Mbox-level targeting takes precedence over other levels, For
			 example, if there is a conflict between an experience-level target and an
			 mbox-level target, the mbox-level target will win.

      <title>Order of Targeting Execution</title>
      <p class="- topic/p ">A campaign can have targeted experiences and
		  non-targeted experiences. To determine which experience a visitor sees, Target
		  first tries to match the visitor to one of the targeted experiences. Each
		  experience is attempted in order: the one listed top in the campaign is
		  attempted first, and so on. The visitor sees the first experience that matches.
		  If the visitor does not match any experience's targeting criteria, then that
		  visitor sees a non-targeted experience, if there is one. If there is more than
		  one non-targeted experience, then the non-targeted traffic is split evenly
		  across all of the experiences. If there is no non-targeted experience, then the
		  visitor is not included in the campaign.
