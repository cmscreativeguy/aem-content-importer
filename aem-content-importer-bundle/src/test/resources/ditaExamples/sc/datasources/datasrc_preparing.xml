      <title>Identify and Name the Metrics</title>
      <p>It is important to understand the metrics or measurements that are
		  contained in your data sources, such as 
		  <term>Off-line Sales Revenue by Product</term>, 
		  <term>Returns by Product</term>, or 
		  <term>Ad Impressions by Campaign</term>. These are the names that you
		  can associate with report metrics (events, props, and eVars). 
		</p>
      <p>After you determine the appropriate metric-to-event mappings for the
		  Data Sources data, rename the events with descriptive names appropriate for the
		  associated Data Sources metric. 
		</p>
      <p>See 
		  <xref href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=success_event" format="https" scope="external">Success Events</xref> in Admin Tools Help. 
		</p>
      <note>Adobe strongly recommends using new, empty events with Data Sources
		  data, but in rare cases it might make sense to use a pre-existing event. 
		</note>

    <section id="section_8EC6BDC4AA314D9EB85F6FCD8E6ABC0A">
      <title>Identify the Data Dimensions</title>
      <p>Identify and gather the data (reports) that you want to use to
		  breakdown the metrics imported through Data Sources. This data is known as 
		  <term>data dimensions</term>. 
		</p>
      <p>For example, if a Data Sources metric measures ad impressions, your
		  data dimension is likely the campaign tracking code. If you are measuring
		  off-line sales, you might want to use product code (or SKU) as your data
		  dimension. 
		</p>
      <p>You can define multiple data dimensions to a metric, but each metric
		  must provide a relevant value, or combination of values, for each associated
		  data dimension. For example, if you import an Off-line Sales metric and
		  associate it with 
		  <term>Product</term> and 
		  <term>Partner</term> data dimensions, the Off-line Sales metric must be
		  relevant for each combination of product and partner (for example, Total
		  Revenue). 
		</p>
      <note>It is possible to import Total metrics that cannot be broken down
		  by any data dimension. 
		</note>
      <p>After you define the data dimensions to use with a data source,
		  integrate the dimensions data into marketing reports by mapping it to a
		  variable. Use either standard reports (for example, Product, Tracking Code,
		  Search Keyword) or Conversion Traffic variables (eVars). 
		</p>
      <p>When using eVars, you can use either existing eVars or new eVars as
		  data dimensions. After selecting an eVar to receive a data dimension from Data
		  Sources, make sure you name them appropriately. 
		</p>
      <p>See 
		  <xref href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=success_event" format="https" scope="external">Success Events</xref> in Analytics Help.

      <title>Campaign Tracking Code</title>
      <p>In addition to importing success events, you can optionally import
		  associated eVar values. For example, if you track online activity with a
		  Campaign Tracking Code, and have Campaign Tracking Codes for the offline
		  metrics, you can import the metrics with Campaign Tracking Codes. This approach
		  allows you to view both online and offline metrics in Campaign reports. 
		</p>
      <p>If you do not import Data Sources metrics with an associated eVar
		  value, you cannot view Data Source metrics broken down by eVars. Rather, you
		  can only see Total metrics.

      <p>The Transaction ID is used to connect an online event to an offline
		  event.

      <title>Identify a Valid Date Range for Data Source Data</title>
      <p>After you define your Data Sources metrics (Custom Events) and data
		  dimensions (eVars), review the date range of the Data Source data that you want
		  to import. You cannot import Data Sources that fall outside the range of your
		  existing reporting data. 
		</p>
      <p>For example, you cannot import Data Source data from before you
		  implemented on-line data tracking. Data Sources data should be broken down by
		  day.
