      <title>Customer Integration</title>
      <p>Customer IDs are used to specify a customer's offline activity and tie
		  it to online activity. These should be used when: 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_D661FE1AA60047418CC7263D57B53885">
        <li id="li_4DD94237C8F74EDF8FABBCF980A14FD7">A customer ID is populated
			 in the 
			 <varname>visitorID</varname> variable. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_DAFBCBAE5CAF45BF90F9E91212CA9A1E">There is no designated
			 point where customer activity moves offline, such as a lead submission or
			 purchase. 
		  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To configure this type of data source, see 
		  <xref href="datasrc_visitorID.xml#concept_1CFAA61D57A84B22A41F7A8E0DFCAAB5" type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Visitor ID?></xref></p>

      <title>Transaction Integration</title>
      <p>Transaction IDs are used to record the state of a visitor at a point
		  in time. These should be used when there is a point in time when customers
		  typically move their experience from online to offline, such as: 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_13334605E6A34B52B68E79F0ADE1FAC1">
        <li id="li_95640A08DE254A6494841C6A29AFDEFA">Submits a lead for a
			 salesman to contact the customer. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_C5289E9A47024C1B9CF93383319A819A">Makes an online purchase,
			 which might be later returned in store. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_E0AAACED909B43A788B878BA29AC5728">Purchases a product for
			 which they might later call for support. 
		  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The customer is often anonymous when they move from online to offline.
		  
		</p>
      <p>Transaction ID events are not included in Visit Participation metrics
		  (those shown in marketing reports), but they are included in Visitor
		  Participation metrics (available only in ad hoc analysis). 
		</p>
      <p>The is because the transaction ID data is not associated with a visit
		  (because the offline event is usually not part of the online event), but it is
		  associated with the visitor.
