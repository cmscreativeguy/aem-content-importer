    <p> Use the Data Sources Wizard to generate an import template. The Data
		Sources import file includes the following data: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_B76BFC24AEE34A5B85A9A61960A9CFA9">
      <li id="li_04335DCBFF90486F90573D65B1312339">A pound symbol (#)
		  identifies that row as a comment. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_D923EFC528E84BCC8A7502A4206E4A58">You can add additional
		  comments to the file, as needed. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_431DF1509F024AF28F8923A3D7D018E8">A comment that lists the
		  template file title. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_602CBE53A7994F8CAF37349819190E81">A comment that lists the
		  external metric and data dimension names specified in the 
		  <wintitle>Data Source Activation Wizard</wintitle>. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Column headings are used to identify the data in each column of the Data
		Source file. There are three types of column headings: 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Date</b>: (Required) A time stamp for each data row in the file. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Variables</b>: The names of the reporting variables mapped to the data
		source’s data dimensions. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Events</b>: The names of the events mapped to the data source’s
		metrics. 
	 </p>
    <p>Use the Data Source template to create a Data Sources file that contains
		data that you want to upload. When creating a Data Sources file, remember the
		following: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_B475F946172B42A5A93A5D767B72A159">
      <li id="li_A3072B4E44724BC7B218E1DC4E18C8FE">
        <p>Effectively, each row in the Data Sources file contains one data
			 record, where each record is made up of a series of tab-separated fields. The
			 column headers in the Data Source template define the order of these fields.
			 For example: 
		  </p>
        <codeblock>		#Sample data file for mycorp_report_suite 
		#Imported data for ad impressions applied to Event 6
		Date 				Tracking Code 					Event 6 
		1/1/2009 				NYT8453A 					8754
		1/1/2009 				WSJ4453B 					9492
		1/1/2009 				BHG44563 					10553
		1/2/2009 				NYT8453A 					6452
		1/2/2009 				WSJ4453B 					7237
		1/2/2009 				BHG44563 					9031</codeblock>
      </li>
      <li id="li_C4A028D5517E4B0CB705B5463883060D">
        <p>If you upload multiple data files, Data Sources loads them in
			 alphabetical order. Files that need to be in processed chronologically must be
			 named such that their alphabetical order corresponds to their chronological
			 order. For example: 
		  </p>
        <codeblock>log_2009-01-01_13:00.txt
log_2009-01-01_13:15.txt
log_2009-01-01_13:30.txt</codeblock>
      </li>
      <li id="li_47FF8AA561BC491F88DC6214D703B48E">To speed processing of your
		  Data Sources file, Adobe recommends aggregating event (metric) data into a
		  single row per date. 
		  <p>For example, if your Data Sources file maps ad impression data to
			 Event 6, create a single data row that includes the total number of ad
			 impressions for each day, rather than creating a separate data row entry for
			 each ad impression that occurred on a particular day. 
		  </p></li>
      <li id="li_921F9B67D15B4D98B3554CA7982758D4">If you need to upload data
		  from dates prior your report suite's creation date, contact your Account
		  Manager to change the oldest date for which you can run reports. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>.FIN file</b>
    </p>
    <p>When you have finished filling out your Data Source file, you can FTP it
		into marketing reports. However, an additional file is needed in order for your
		data to be processed. You will need to upload an empty text file with the same
		name of your data file, but with a 
		<filepath>.fin</filepath> extension.
	 </p>
    <p>For example, if you upload a (tab-delimited) data file called 
		<filepath>myproductdata.txt</filepath>, you would also be required to
		upload an empty text file called 
		<filepath>myproductdata.fin</filepath>. Without the 
		<filepath>.fin</filepath> file, data would never be processed.
