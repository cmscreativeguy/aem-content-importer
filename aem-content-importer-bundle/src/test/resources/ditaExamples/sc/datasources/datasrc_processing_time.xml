		<li id="li_CA76005D28C7454AB95879018CDA27AA">Data for the Current Day:
		  Processing completes approximately 1 hour 30 minutes after the data upload.

		<li id="li_105970643DAC4A1999CF494CC4525A9F">Data for the Previous Day:
		  Processing completes approximately 2 hours after the data upload.
		</li>
	 </ul>
	 <p>Each additional day in the upload adds approximately 1 hour to the
		processing time, up to a maximum of 17 hours.

	 <p>For example, if you upload data for the previous day, the data will be
		visible in Analytics in approximately 2 hours. If you upload data for the
		previous month, the data will be visible in Analytics in approximately 17
		hours.
