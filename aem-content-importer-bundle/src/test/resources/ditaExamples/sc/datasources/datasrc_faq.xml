		<title>How much does it cost to use the Data Source feature? </title> 
		<p>Data Sources does not carry any additional fees beyond the standard
		  server call. Server call charges apply only to full-processing data source
		  types, where individual hits are sent in as rows of data. Traffic and aggregate
		  level data sources do not incur additional costs.

		<title>How do I include comments in Data Sources files? </title> 
		<p>Each row in a Data Sources file that begins with a pound sign (#) is
		  treated as a comment.

	 <section id="section_EA37F5FFB13446C497B3C64943F7084E"> 
		<title>Do I have to include a date column in my spreadsheet data?</title>
		
		<p>Yes. Because many marketing reports are keyed from the date column,
		  Data Sources requires a date column.

		<title>Can I store data in existing variables that I’m already
		  using?</title> 
		<p>Adobe recommends you select new, unused variables to import data using
		  Data Sources. If you are uncertain about the configuration of your data file,
		  or want to better understand the risks of re-using variables, contact Customer
		  Care. 
		</p>

	 <section id="section_DB73BC06BD774738BF019B347D9DED96"> 
		<title>Can I delete data that was imported using Data Sources? </title> 
		<p>No. Data uploaded into reports using Data Sources cannot be removed,
		  even by Adobe technicians, once it has been imported. It is inserted into your
		  existing data permanently, and becomes indistinguishable from your data entered
		  through traditional data collection means (i.e. JavaScript, ActionSource, Data
		  Insertion API, etc.). Therefore, Adobe strongly recommends uploading Data
		  Sources data into a test report suite before uploading into a production suite.

		<title>How much data can I import at a time?</title> 
		<p>Processing pauses if the size exceeds 50 MB and does not resume until
		  the total is below 50 MB. To limit delays in generating reports, do not upload
		  more than 90 days of data per day.

		<title>When I import data through Data Sources, is the existing data
		  overwritten?</title> 
		<p>Data Sources data never overwrite existing report data. Instead, data
		  uploaded using Data Sources is added to the existing data.

		<title>When I upload my data via Data Sources, why don't I get my metrics
		  as well?</title> 
		<p>When you upload Data Sources data, you are uploading the metrics that
		  will be available in the report interface. 
		</p> 
		<p>For example, if you are uploading Call Center Revenue for products you
		  sell on your site, you can have that Call Center Revenue in the same report as
		  Online Revenue. However, you will not be able to use it in conjunction with
		  Visits, because you didn’t upload the number of Visits with it. Adobe can only
		  report on the metrics and elements that you uploaded through Data Sources (in
		  addition to the regular marketing report metrics).

		<title>What is the difference between a Traffic and a Conversion
		  (Generic) Data Source?</title> 
		<p>The Traffic Data Source uploads much faster since it merely updates
		  the summary values into the appropriate tables. The Generic Data Source with
		  conversion data (events etc.) creates a hit for every value in the column to be
		  processed.

		<title>Does Data Sources take subrelations, correlations, and pathing
		  into account?</title> 
		<p>Since the Data Source process ("for Generic DS, non-Traffic") builds
		  individual hits that are processed by cache, the subrelation process is used,
		  but not the correlation process. Pathing has the potential to be processed, but
		  each hit would be its own visit, so no pathing is generated. Pathing data is
		  generated for Web log imports.

		<title>Are the file extensions case-sensitive for a Data Source upload or
		  a classification file?</title> 
		<p>If the extensions of a Data Source upload file or a classification
		  file are capitalized, the files will not be processed. Data Source upload file
		  extensions must be lowercase. For example, 
		  <filepath>file.TXT</filepath> and 
		  <filepath>file.FIN</filepath> will not be processed. Similarly, 
		  <filepath>.TAB</filepath> and 
		  <filepath>.FIN</filepath> will not be processed. However, 
		  <filepath>.txt</filepath> and 
		  <filepath>.fin</filepath> are processed.

		<p>You can add in as many events as you like. However, the wizard allows
		  for only three events only. Once the template file is created you can add in
		  more events as needed.

		<title>Is Data Sources information rolled up?</title> 
		<p>Data Sources information can be rolled up; however, Adobe Customer
		  Care must reprocess the rollup from the historical date to include the
		  historical data. For example, if the current date is 31 October 2011 and you
		  upload data for 1-15 August 2011 using Data Sources, the rollup must be set to
		  reprocess beginning with 1 August 2011, so that the newly imported data is
		  included. 
		</p> 
		<p>Also note that data should never be uploaded directly into a rollup
		  report suite using Data Sources. If you need this data included in a rollup, it
		  should be imported into a standard report suite, also called a 
		  <term>child suite</term> to the rollup. Contact Adobe Customer Care for
		  more information.

		<title>Why does the Page Views Report not show any Data Sources data for
		  a single day, but it shows the correct data for a week?</title> 
		<p>Data Sources does not report data on an hourly basis. When you try to
		  run a report for a particular day, the data can be broken down only by the hour
		  so nothing shows in the report. You can see data only when it is broken down by
		  a level of granularity of daily or higher, which can be accomplished by running
		  a weekly or a monthly report.

		<title>How are Unique Visitors calculated in a web server log Data Source
		  upload?</title> 
		<p>The number of Unique Visitors in a web-server log is calculated as the
		  different distinct combinations of 
		  <term>IP Address</term> and 
		  <term>User Agent</term> in the Web log. Each unique combination of
		  these two items is calculated as a Unique Visitor. If the 
		  <wintitle>User Agent</wintitle> column is blank (or not included in the
		  web log) then we are unable to identify Unique Visitor counts, and the entire
		  upload will count as just one Unique Visitor (even if there are multiple IP
		  addresses).

		<title>In Data Sources, how can I tell which login belongs to which
		  report suite?</title> 
		<p>In Data Sources, the report suite ID is the first part of the login
		  appended by a random number that identifies the specific data source that was
		  set up. For example, 
		  <codeph>RSID-drmossdev5 Login-drmossdev5_0001343430</codeph>.

		<title>Are eVars that are currently persisting in the Visitor Profile

		<p>No for full processing, yes for transaction ID. Full processing data
		  sources are processed using separate visitor profiles, so even if the visitor
		  IDs match, they won’t be tied to together from an eVar allocation perspective.
		  Transaction ID data sources are tied to the main visitor profile, so persisting
