    <p>By integrating offline data, you can leverage data sources to integrate:

    <ul id="ul_6A889E5612554833902D338899972C71">

    <p>Data integration helps you understand transactions as a whole. Think of
		how your customers interact with your site. They first search or get referred
		from another domain; they land on your site peruse and then purchase; some
		might return the product via phone or in-store. Both the pre-click data
		(searches prior to last one that drove to your site, impressions, cost, etc)
		and “after-the-sale” information (returns, call center data) can be integrated.
		
	 </p>
    <p>You can use Data Sources to help understand the pre-click data by
		importing the data via the search engine or ad network. This will make it
		possible to calculate ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) by bringing in the cost data
		and dividing the revenue by the cost (Revenue/Cost). You can also use it to
		help understand the “after-the-sale” data to get a more accurate ROAS picture
		by bringing information such as Return Revenue or Return Units. 
	 </p>
    <p>Now with Data Sources you can get that end to end or 360 degree view of
		your business to take action off of this increased insight. 
	 </p>
    <p>After import, most Data Sources data is available throughout the Digital
		Marketing Suite.
