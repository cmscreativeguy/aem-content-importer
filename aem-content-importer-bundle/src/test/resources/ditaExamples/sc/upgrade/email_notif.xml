	 </p> 
	 <p>Good news! As of &lt;upgrade date&gt;, all 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> report suites will upgrade to the 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 platform. 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 offers many new features, including: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_84D55541BE7D40A58857386CA95159FE"> 
		<li id="li_B82155CD57FB42A1BC2A28473C007E99">Real-time segmentation on
		  all reports 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_DCF44E99A2DC437899FED1E0B33E67CC">Full subrelations enabled on
		  all conversion reports by default 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_6D3DAEA01DAC42429FFBF6AC53F63D5C">Improved metric calculations
		  for more accurate analysis 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_E454E3CAE8F54EE8A4EF0D882278514C">Improved dashboard and
		  administration capabilities 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_43785683AF204E6CBAD6CA6100444C24">And much more, outlined in
		  the attached Feature Overview 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>With this change you should be aware that the improved metric
		calculations in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 might affect your current reports, as
		outlined here: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_A311F107F1E442DD85EE5CBD5F8039B2"> 
		<li id="li_48CC4C278DD3410FB9C2A897331C4B66">The 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric now includes visitors without a
		  visitor ID cookie. This change typically increases 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle>, and also affects any calculated metrics
		  that rely on the 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric, such as 
		  <wintitle>Success Events per Visit</wintitle>. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_0C0F27CBB30E4EC98348DED4AE1FCA27"><wintitle>Time
			 Spent</wintitle> metrics more accurately calculate a visitorâ€™s time spent on a
		  page. This change typically increases 
		  <wintitle>Time Spent</wintitle> metric. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_DD8DB0FD224A40BF878B9B527B1871D6"><wintitle>Unique
			 Visits</wintitle> and 
		  <wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> metrics in classification reports
		  no longer duplicate visitor counts. This change reduces the reported number of
		  unique visits and visitors to a website. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_D0AFF8C4121149E2A45AA3E7869A7219"><wintitle>Orders</wintitle>
		  and other metrics on merchandising eVars is similarly not duplicated on 
		  <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15. This change may reduce the reported
		  metrics on merchandising eVar reports. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Carefully review the attached 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 Feature Overview for more information
		about the data processing changes in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15. Direct any questions or concerns you
		might have to &lt;SiteCatalyst Administrator&gt;.
