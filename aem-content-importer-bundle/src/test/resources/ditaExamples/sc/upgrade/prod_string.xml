  <title>Category Section of the Product String</title> 
  <shortdesc>If you provided a category section in your product string, 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> version 14 made a 1:1 association between
	 the product and category.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>For example:
	 </p>
	 <p><filepath>s.products=”category;product;quantity;price;...”</filepath>
	 </p>
	 <p>In 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14, the first category associated with a
		product in a calendar month would be tied to that product for the entire month.
	 </p>
	 <p><keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 allows multiple categories per
		product. If you have products in multiple categories in the product string, you
		might see different values in the category report than you did before.
