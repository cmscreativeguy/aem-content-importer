  <title>Remove Duplicate Visitors and Unique Visits</title> 
  <shortdesc>Previously, 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> did not remove duplicate 
	 <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> and 
	 <wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> metrics from classifications-based
	 reports.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>For example, if two video clips shared the same classification, a single
		visitor that viewed both clips generated two 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> in the classification-based report.
	 </p>
	 <p><keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 removes duplicate 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> from the classification-based
		report. This is a more accurate measure of 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Visitors</wintitle>, but typically results in a decrease in
		your 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> metrics for classification-based
		reports, when compared to data collected prior to upgrade.
