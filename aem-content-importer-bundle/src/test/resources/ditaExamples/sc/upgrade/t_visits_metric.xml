		<p>To calculate the 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric, 
		  <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14 reported only on visitors who
		  accepted a tracking cookie. 
		  <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 more accurately measures 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> by including visitors who do not accept a
		  tracking cookie. As a result, the 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric in most cases reports a larger value
		  when compared to previous 
		  <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> versions under the same circumstances. 
		</p> 
		<p>This change affects any report that uses the 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric, including 
		  <wintitle>Path</wintitle> reports and calculated metrics. Calculated
		  metric values can increase or decrease, depending on whether 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> is the denominator or numerator in the
		  calculation. For example, in an 
		  <wintitle>Orders / Visit</wintitle> calculation the value is likely to
		  decrease. In 
		  <wintitle>Visits / Visitor</wintitle>, the value is likely to increase.

		<p>The non-persistent cookie visitors are added to the results. You can
		  download the report to CSV or Excel and divide the non-persistent cookie
		  visitors by total visitors. This represents the percent by which the visits
		  increase after you upgrade to 
		  <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15. This increase ranges from 0.2% (for
		  report suites fed entirely by first-party cookies) to 11-14% for report suites
		  entirely on third-party cookies.
