  <title>Improved Reporting Limits for Monthly Unique Values</title> 
  <shortdesc>When a report has a large number of unique values, 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> now includes functionality to ensure that
	 the most important values appear in your report. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>At the beginning of each calendar month, 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> includes the first 500,000 values
		received for any single variable in reports. This includes page names, and
		other traffic and commerce variables. For example, each unique page name on
		your site counts toward this total. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>After 500,000 unique values are received, 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> begins to optimize which values are
		displayed in reports. When new values are received after this threshold, 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> initially groups these values in a single
		line item in reports titled 
		<wintitle>Uniques Exceeded</wintitle>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If one of these values begins to receive significant traffic, the value
		is reported as a separate line item in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> along with the first 500,000 values for
		the remainder of the month (the first 500,000 values are always reported
		separately regardless of traffic). 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If the number of unique values exceed 1 million in a single month, a
		second threshold is applied which requires more traffic before a value is
		reported as a separate line item in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword>. For example, a new page that starts to
		receive 100 hits per day is reported as a separate line item, but a new page
		that receives fewer than 10 hits might not. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14 and 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 have the same threshold limits before
		management starts. These thresholds are 500,000 and 1 million unique values by
		default. All values, including each unique value in 
		<wintitle>Uniques Exceeded</wintitle>, are available in 
		<keyword>DataWarehouse</keyword> reports. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If you have a custom unique value limit, the following applies: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_C31CBFE88A064CDEA82358048DE6DE05"> 
		<li id="li_85F8C357AD874E919935B7B8BD359A05">If you have a uniques limit
		  set to less than 500,000, your limit is used for both the lower and upper
		  thresholds. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_8C68D48576A54A16A33561E61932AA05">If you have a uniques limit
		  set between 500,000 and 1,000,000 today, your limit is used for the lower
		  threshold and 1,000,000 for the upper threshold. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_F3D122BFD934462499205CE7C27F66CD">If you have a uniques limit
		  set above 1,000,000 today, your limit is used for both the lower and upper
		  thresholds. 
		</li> 
	 </ul>
