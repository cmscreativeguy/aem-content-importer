  <title>Updated Visits Metric for Typed Bookmarked in Referring Domains
	 Report</title> 
  <shortdesc>If you had the 
	 <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric enabled on the 
	 <wintitle>Referring Domains</wintitle> report in 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14, youâ€™ll notice a change to the 
	 <wintitle>Visit</wintitle> count on this report after upgrading to 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>In 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14, 
		<wintitle>Typed/Bookmarked</wintitle> was counted anytime a visit
		contained a server call with no referrer specified, regardless of where the
		server call occurred during the visit.
	 </p>
	 <p>Since the referrer can often be empty mid-visit due to actions such as 
		<keyword>Flash</keyword> navigation and redirects, 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 was improved to count 
		<wintitle>Typed/Bookmarked</wintitle> only when a visit starts with a
		server call with no referrer specified.
	 </p>
	 <p>With this change, in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 
		<wintitle>Instances of Typed/Bookmarked</wintitle> should match 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle>, whereas, in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14, 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> were typically lower than 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle>.
