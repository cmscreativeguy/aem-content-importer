  <title>Metric Changes</title> 
  <shortdesc>Metric changes between 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14 and 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15.

  <conbody> 
	 <p><b>Page Views, Visits, and Unique Visitors:</b> These metrics are
		available on all reports (with a few exceptions). The 
		<wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> metric represents unique visitors
		for the time period of the report, rather than the sum of daily unique
		visitors. 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> are available on all custom insight reports
		without enabling pathing. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><b>Page Views and Instances in Custom Traffic (Prop) Reports:</b> In 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14, 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> reports displayed 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> as 
		<wintitle>Page Views</wintitle>. In 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15, we added the 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> metric to 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> reports. Now, 
		<wintitle>Page Views</wintitle> reflects the number of page views where a
		property variable is set. The 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> metric represents the number of times the
		variable is set, whether on link clicks, video views, page views, or other
		server calls. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><b>Bounces:</b> A new metric defined as a single hit visit with no other
		link event. For example, a single page visit is a bounce if a visitor does not
		interact with the page in way that sends data to Adobe, such as clicking a link
		or a video start. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><b>Bounce Rate:</b> A new metric defined as 
		<wintitle>Bounces</wintitle> divided by 
		<wintitle>Entries</wintitle>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><b>Lifetime Metrics:</b> No longer available.
