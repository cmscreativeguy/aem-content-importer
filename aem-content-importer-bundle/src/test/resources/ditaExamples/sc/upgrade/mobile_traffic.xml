  <title>How Mobile Traffic Displays in Technology Reports</title> 
  <shortdesc><keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 includes mobile devices in all
	 technology reports, but differentiates mobile technology from non-mobile

  <conbody>
	 <p>For example, if you run a 
		<wintitle>Browsers</wintitle> report (<uicontrol>Visitor
		  Profile</uicontrol> &gt; 
		<uicontrol>Technology</uicontrol> &gt; 
		<uicontrol>Browser</uicontrol>) and apply a 
		<wintitle>Visits from Mobile Device</wintitle> segment, the data displays
		under None in the report table. This functionality also applies to mobile
		reports that are broken down by 
		<wintitle>Browser</wintitle>. In the affected reports, you might see an
		increase of visitors that do not accept cookies or JavaScript because visitors
		are using mobile devices.
