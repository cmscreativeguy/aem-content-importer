  <title>Data Accessibility</title> 
  <shortdesc>In 
	 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15, data is available on average 45 minutes
	 after receipt.
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody>
	 <p>The data is processed in one-hour blocks. About 30 minutes after the end
		of an hour, data for that hour is visible in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15. For the next hour, data is processed
		into a batch. As such, data availability oscillates between 30 and 90 minutes.
		This delay decreases with future releases of 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword>.
	 </p>
	 <p>In 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14, different types of data were
		available at different intervals. For example, traffic data was available to 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> reports in a 90-second delay, while
		conversion data was available in a 20-30-minute delay.
	 </p>
	 <p><keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 applies consistent data availability
		rules across all types of collected data. For example, in 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14 the 
		<wintitle>Page Views</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metrics were updated at different times. This
		difference caused calculated metrics (such as 
		<wintitle>Page Views per Visit</wintitle>) to be overstated for the
		current day. In 
		<keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15, all metrics and dimensions appear at
		the same time, providing a more consistent view of your metrics.
