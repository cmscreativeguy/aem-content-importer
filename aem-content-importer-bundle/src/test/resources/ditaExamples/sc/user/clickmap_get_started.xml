      <title>How do I begin using Visitor Click Map?</title>
      <p>In order to successfully collect data, the following must be present:
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_0587652DC4A642108185B3C1BD4F8902">
        <li id="li_CB9908DCC5F94D64A9DB865F831D02EF">s.trackInlineStats must be
			 set to 
			 <cmdname>true</cmdname> within your core JavaScript file (s_code.js).
		  </li>
        <li id="li_7FD4250DDE3244339E84C21023F8B649">The Page ID (ClickMap) and
			 Object ID (ClickMap) variables must be present within a given image request
			 after you click on at least one link. These variables are also known as the pid
			 and oid variables. Generally, if s.trackInlineStats is set to true, these will
			 automatically populate and can be seen in our DigitalPulse Debugger.
		  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once Visitor Click Map is installed, log in with your Adobe Analytics
		  credentials and browse to the page on which you'd like to view the heatmap.
		</p>

      <title>What are some common best practices and pitfalls to be aware
		  of?</title>
      <ul id="ul_D2AE5325C7594844AD7488325F14752F">
        <li id="li_3A98E882471543459A2FF1E36A889A3B">Implementing the
			 s_objectID variable on each link will greatly increase your accuracy for Click
			 Map. Sometimes dynamic links or even links in different browsers report to
			 Reports &amp; Analytics differently, and therefore receives a different Object
			 ID.
		  </li>
        <li id="li_82D808752C4B40DC9A42A45F947B8160">URLs that appear to be
			 similar may be different according to Adobe Analytics. For example, mysite.com
			 and www.mysite.com can be recorded as different pages in Click Map. Again,
			 using the s_objectID variable is the best way to ensure links are accurately
			 recorded, even across browsers.
