		<title>Do I need to re-tag my site to use marketing reports and

		<p>No, with the exception of your video implementation. If you are not

		<title>Why do I need ad hoc analysis (Discover), if I can create segments
		  in marketing reports?</title> 
		<p> Marketing reports are ideal for broadly disseminating data across an
		  organization. In ad hoc analysis, you can perform deep, fast, effective
		  analysis of online data. The two products complement each other and deliver a
		  powerful online analytic solution.

		<title>How are data sources handled in marketing reporting and
		  analytics?</title> 
		<p>Data sources behave differently based on the source type:

		<ul id="ul_ED394313E6A5430FBFBCD940DC6B9FD4"> 
		  <li id="li_ECE4710036BE40DBBC510CCAE5AA6DEE">Full processing, web log,
			 and transaction ID data sources appear as normal. When segments are applied,
			 the data is filtered according to the segment rules. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_33357448120E4A58990593322DEB87FD">Standard or conversion
			 data sources (ad campaigns, CRM, customer satisfaction, site performance,
			 generic summary data, online purchases, leads and quotes, and offline channel
			 data) appear in marketing reporst. However, because those data sources are not
			 tied to visits or visitors, they are filtered out when segments are applied. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_A455B44DC7024ABE8F4D5981A59D62EC">Traffic data sources
			 (<uicontrol>Website Usage</uicontrol> &gt; 
			 <uicontrol>Traffic Data Source</uicontrol>) do not appear in
			 marketing reports. 
		  </li> 
		</ul> 
		<p>You can identify whether a report suite has a traffic data source by
		  going to 
		  <uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> &gt; 
		  <uicontrol>Data Sources</uicontrol> and looking for an entry showing
		  “Type: Traffic Data Source,” like this:

		<p>The Include Current Data feature provides many common metrics within
		  minutes. Other metrics are available between 10 and 35 minutes, or between 45
