				  <p> Enables the report accelerator, which uses a time- based
					 algorithm to cache recently requested reports and examines only the most
					 frequently occurring unique items, resulting in even faster delivery of
					 reports. By caching requested reports for 15 minutes, the report accelerator
					 can retrieve those reports for subsequent requests almost instantaneously. This
					 setting is helpful when browsing back and forth, printing reports, or for
					 frequent access to the same reports. When disabled, the system regenerates
					 reports each time they are requested.

				</entry> 
				<entry colname="col2"> 
				  <p>Enables the dashboard accelerator, which stores a cached
					 version of your dashboard for subsequent viewing. By caching a view of your
					 dashboard for 24 hours, the dashboard accelerator is able to retrieve that view
					 almost instantaneously because the intensive database querying and processing
					 is done ahead of time. If the available cached version is more than 24 hours
					 old, a new dashboard is generated and a new, cached version created. Likewise,
					 a new, cached version is created whenever you update the dashboard (or any
					 reportlet displayed on the dashboard). The cache is user-based. Other users
					 viewing a shared dashboard see a version based on their own use of dashboard
					 accelerator and updating of the dashboard.

					 configured (set to the defaults) no currency conversion takes place, and all
