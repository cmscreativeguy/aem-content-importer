  <title>Segmentation containers</title>
  <shortdesc>Knowing the difference between the page view, visit, and visitor
	 containers gives you much more control over your reporting. It also helps you
	 understand what data is returned.

  <conbody>
    <p>Segmentation works by scanning through every hit within the time period
		selected, checking to see if that image request matches your segmentation
		rules. 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_79C937DB0E6A4F078CE7FD1E583CE9FA">
      <li id="li_538FB2926FE643288ED37CF9A5272EB5">If it matches, then that hit
		  is part of your segment (along with additional data, depending on the
		  container). 
		</li>
      <li id="li_A3A3B0B0B33F49519809A75890A44B48">If it does not match, the
		  hit is treated as if it didn't exist in context of the segmented report. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To help illustrate the differences between each containers, consider the
		following example: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_18BF056754674AB399E0B6B6DAC2C59E">
      <li id="li_48F89FC954A84C41A91AA46B10C16456">A customer comes to your
		  site via Natural Search, views one of your products, then leaves. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_6E214C825B9C4013BEEA171BF1DA85B7">That same customer returns
		  the next day via a bookmark, and purchases that item. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <section id="section_7AF52DADE8084B47A7CB27D130A53477">
      <title>Page Views container</title>
      <p>The Page Views container is the most narrow of the containers
		  available. When a rule within a page view container matches a hit, only that
		  individual hit is included in the segment. Unless other hits within an
		  individual's visit also match the rule, all other hits are excluded. Using the
		  above example, the following segment is used: 
		</p>
      <p>
        <image placement="break" align="left" href="graphics/page_views.png" width="150px" id="image_AE1BE167AD944118A5902A47EDB3C673"></image>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i> Include all hits where Referrer Type is Natural Search</i>. 
		</p>
      <p>This container includes only a single hit: the customer's first hit to
		  your site. If you tried viewing the number of orders or product views with this
		  segment, you would not see any data. The individual hit that actually made the
		  purchase has a referrer of the billing information/checkout page. Since the
		  purchase page's referrer is not considered Natural Search, it is not included
		  in the subsequent report. 
		</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section_2DFC8929865341CB80DDF54127404367">
      <title>Visits container</title>
      <p>The Visits container is the most commonly used segmentation container.
		  Again, using the above as an example, the following segment is used: 
		</p>
      <p>
        <image placement="break" align="left" href="graphics/visit.png" width="100px" id="image_ED9846B6D7864A9BB418467CAD595090"></image>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i> Include all hits where Referrer Type is Natural Search.</i>
      </p>
      <p>This segment scans through all the hits on your site, and if one
		  matches, all hits that occurred within that visit are included. Looking at
		  product views using this segment would now display data. The hit that matched
		  the rule set not only brought in the individual hit that matched, but the rest
		  of that customer's visit. 
		</p>
      <p>Orders, however, would still not display data. Since the purchase
		  event occurred on a different visit, this example's orders and revenue would
		  still not be shown using this segment. 
		</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section_D480F2E1B9454152AF7397341EA86B45">
      <title>Visitors container</title>
      <p>The Visitors container is the largest of the three available
		  "buckets". Once it finds a hit that matches your rule, it pulls in all hits
		  within that same visit. It also pulls all hits across all visits that
		  individual generated. Using the same above example in context of a Visitors
		  container: 
		</p>
      <p>
        <image placement="break" align="left" href="graphics/visitors.png" width="100px" id="image_9C9842E2CFF040278F761DF0BF145911"></image>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i> Include all hits where Referrer Type is Natural Search.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Since the same visitor that entered your site via Natural Search also
		  eventually made a purchase, Adobe Analytics includes all hits in your segment. 
		</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section_49135E944B524261A64F096ABD803C32">
      <title>Pitfalls and Tips</title>
      <p>It is important to understand that having a broader segment is not
		  always necessarily better. If you wanted visits where Referrer Type was Natural
		  Search, using a Visitors container would not return desired data. It would also
		  include many other visits that did not begin with Natural Search. In this
		  specific scenario, a Visits container would be best. 
		</p>
      <p>If you have questions about which container matches closest to the
		  data you're looking for, contact one of your organization's supported users.
		  They can provide advice based on your specific implementation.
