  <title>Updated Visits Metric for Typed/Bookmarked in Referring Domains
	 Report</title>
  <shortdesc>If you had Visits enabled for conversion metrics in 
	 SiteCatalyst 14, you will notice a change to the 
	 <wintitle>Visit</wintitle> count on this report after upgrading to 
	 SiteCatalyst 15.

  <conbody>
    <p>In 
		SiteCatalyst 14, a 
		<wintitle>Typed/Bookmarked</wintitle> visit was counted anytime there was
		a server call with no referrer specified, regardless of where the server call
		occurred during the visit. In SiteCatalyst 14, a 
		<wintitle>Typed/Bookmarked</wintitle> instance was counted only when the
		visit starts with a server call with no referrer specified.
	 </p>
    <p>Since the referrer can often be empty mid-visit due to actions such as 
		Flash navigation and redirects, the instances and
		visits metric typically did not match in SiteCatalyst 14.
	 </p>
    <p>
      SiteCatalyst 15 was improved to count 
		<wintitle>Typed/Bookmarked</wintitle> only when a visit starts with a
		server call with no referrer specified. 
	 </p>
    <p>With this change, in 
		SiteCatalyst 15 
		<wintitle>Instances of Typed/Bookmarked</wintitle> should match 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle>, whereas, in 
		SiteCatalyst 14, 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> were typically lower than 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle>.
