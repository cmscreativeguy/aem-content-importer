  <title> Data Warehouse Requests</title>
  <shortdesc>
    Data warehouse refers to the copy of raw,
	 unprocessed data for storage and custom reports, which you can run by filtering
	 the data. You can request reports to display advanced data relationships from
	 raw data based on your unique questions. Unlike most reports, which are
	 displayed in the 
	 reporting interface, 
	 data warehouse reports are emailed or sent via FTP, and
	 may take up to 72 hours to process. Processing time depends on the complexity
	 of the query and the amount of data requested.
