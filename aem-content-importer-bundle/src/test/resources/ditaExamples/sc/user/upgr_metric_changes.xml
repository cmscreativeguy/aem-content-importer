		<b>Page Views, Visits, and Unique Visitors:</b> These metrics are
		available on all reports (with a few exceptions). The 
		<wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> metric represents unique visitors
		for the time period of the report, rather than the sum of daily unique
		visitors. 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> are available on all custom insight reports
		without enabling pathing. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Page Views and Instances in Custom Traffic (Prop) Reports:</b> In
		SiteCatalyst 14, 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> reports displayed 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> as 
		<wintitle>Page Views</wintitle>. In version 15, we added the 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> metric to 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> reports. Now, 
		<wintitle>Page Views</wintitle> reflects the number of page views where a
		property variable is set. The 
		<wintitle>Instances</wintitle> metric represents the number of times the
		variable is set, whether on link clicks, video views, page views, or other
		server calls. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Bounces:</b> A new metric defined as a single hit visit with no other
		link event. For example, a single page visit is a bounce if a visitor does not
		interact with the page in way that sends data to Adobe, such as clicking a link
		or a video start. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Bounce Rate:</b> A new metric defined as 
		<wintitle>Bounces</wintitle> divided by 
		<wintitle>Entries</wintitle>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Lifetime Metrics:</b> No longer available. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><b>Unique Visitors</b>: When reporting unique visitor across your
		migration date, the Unique Visitors count will start over. We recommend not
		spanning the migration date in reports utilizing quarterly and yearly Unique
		Visitors metrics.
