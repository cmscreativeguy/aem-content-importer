      <title>Breakdown Scopes</title>
      <p>Every breakdown has a scope to which it applies (as do some metrics).
		  Most breakdowns are page-view based, however there are several that are
		  different. Using these breakdowns with the same segmentation container returns
		  expected data. Using these breakdowns with a different segmentation container
		  returns much different data.
