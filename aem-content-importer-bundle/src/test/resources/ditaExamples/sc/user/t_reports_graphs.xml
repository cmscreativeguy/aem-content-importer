      <p>The type of graphs available depend on the type of report you run. For
		  example, Trend Line graphs are useful for trended reports, but you can also use
		  a Vertical Bar graph with trend lines that clearly illustrate trends over days,
		  weeks, months, and so on. Alternatively, you can choose a Pie chart to
		  illustrate percentages for the pages viewed.

          <p>
            <uicontrol>Trend Line</uicontrol>: Trend lines show daily trends
				for the report metrics and are useful for trending one metric over time per
				line.

          <p>
            <uicontrol>Smooth Line</uicontrol>: You use this graph type with
				the 
				<wintitle>Video Detail Report</wintitle>. It shows the numbers or
				percentages of views for specific segments of a video. A rise in views for a
				specific segment of the video indicates that viewers rewound and viewed that
				section of the video multiple times. If using percentages, the percentage shown
				in the graph is a percentage of all segments viewed, not a percentage of
				viewers who saw the segment. For example, in the graph the sum of all the
				report segments is 39. The number of views for the 0 to 10-seconds segment is
				10. Therefore, the percentage of views for this segment is approximately 26
				percent.

            <uicontrol>Area</uicontrol>: The Area graph is similar to the Trend
				Line graph but fills in the area below the lines. You must be viewing a trended
				report to display the Area graph.

            <uicontrol>Stacked Area</uicontrol>: Stacked Area charts are useful
				when trending a number of products or campaigns over time. For example, if you
				trend the top five products showing revenue, you can quickly see how much total
				revenue those products bring in over time. You can refine the view by using a
				search filter to include or exclude specific products.

          <p>
            <uicontrol>Stacked Vertical Bar</uicontrol>: By stacking similar
				items you can get a quick view of the total influence of an item. For example,
				in a 
				<wintitle>Campaign Report</wintitle>, you can stack similar success
				metrics and see which campaign is generating the most total success. Stacking
				makes it easier to find campaigns that are not the top performers in one metric
				but are top performers in a combination of metrics.

            <uicontrol>Pie</uicontrol>: The Pie chart shows the top metric
				value percentages in relation to each other, and shows the percentage of the
				selected metrics in relation to the whole. You can display the Pie chart for
				ranked reports.

          <p>
            <uicontrol>Scatter</uicontrol>: The Scatter graph shows a scatter
				display of the metrics you select in relation to each other. Scatter graphs let
				you visualize data in two dimensions, so that you can identify which items are
				outliers.

            <uicontrol>Bubble</uicontrol>: The Bubble graph shows a bubble
				display of the metrics you select in relation to each other. The location of
				the bubbles shows the relationships between the metrics on the horizontal and
				vertical axis, while the size of the bubble portrays the main report metric.
				Bubble graphs let you visualize data in two dimensions, so that you can
				identify which items are outliers.
