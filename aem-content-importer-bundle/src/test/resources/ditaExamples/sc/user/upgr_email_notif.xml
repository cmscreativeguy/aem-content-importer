	 </p> 
	 <p>Good news! As of &lt;upgrade date&gt;, all SiteCatalyst report suites
		will upgrade to the SiteCatalyst 15 platform. SiteCatalyst 15 offers many new
		features, including: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_84D55541BE7D40A58857386CA95159FE"> 
		<li id="li_B82155CD57FB42A1BC2A28473C007E99">Real-time segmentation on
		  all reports 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_DCF44E99A2DC437899FED1E0B33E67CC">Full subrelations enabled on
		  all conversion reports by default 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_9141DC7C0F254D9DA58E29B9EB6BFC02">Correlations on all traffic
		  reports by default 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_6D3DAEA01DAC42429FFBF6AC53F63D5C">Improved metric calculations
		  for more accurate analysis 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_E454E3CAE8F54EE8A4EF0D882278514C">Improved dashboard and
		  administration capabilities 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_FF1BEB403C2A4665B3B4096E059E637C">Page views and other common
		  metrics are available within minutes 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_43785683AF204E6CBAD6CA6100444C24">And much more, outlined in
		  the attached Feature Overview 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>With this change you should be aware that the improved metric
		calculations in SiteCatalyst 15 might affect your current reports, as outlined
		here: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul id="ul_A311F107F1E442DD85EE5CBD5F8039B2"> 
		<li id="li_48CC4C278DD3410FB9C2A897331C4B66">The 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric now includes visitors without a
		  visitor ID cookie. This change typically increases 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle>, and also affects any calculated metrics
		  that rely on the 
		  <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metric, such as 
		  <wintitle>Success Events per Visit</wintitle>. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_0C0F27CBB30E4EC98348DED4AE1FCA27"> 
		  <wintitle>Time Spent</wintitle> metrics more accurately calculate a
		  visitor's time spent on a page. This change typically increases 
		  <wintitle>Time Spent</wintitle> metric. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_DD8DB0FD224A40BF878B9B527B1871D6"> 
		  <wintitle>Unique Visits</wintitle> and 
		  <wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> metrics in classification reports
		  no longer duplicate visitor counts. This change reduces the reported number of
		  unique visits and visitors to a website. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_79FE2448B31B4BB49F297531A32AE070">Daily/Weekly/etc. Visitors
		  are now just Unique Visitors. This can have a big effect on dashboards and on
		  calculations based on daily vs. monthly unique visitors. In addition, this
		  leads to improved segmentation capabilities and better performance.
		</li>
		<li id="li_D0AFF8C4121149E2A45AA3E7869A7219"> 
		  <wintitle>Orders</wintitle> and other metrics on merchandising eVars is
		  similarly not duplicated on SiteCatalyst 15. This change may reduce the
		  reported metrics on merchandising eVar reports. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Carefully review the attached SiteCatalyst 15 Feature Overview for more
		information about the data processing changes in SiteCatalyst 15. Direct any
		questions or concerns you might have to &lt;SiteCatalyst Administrator&gt;.
