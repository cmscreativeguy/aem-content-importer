  <title>Conversion Reports - Counting Visits and Daily Unique Visitors</title>
  <shortdesc>All visits are counted in conversion reports, regardless of
	 whether the visitor triggered a conversion event. In SiteCatalyst 14, 
	 <wintitle>Visits</wintitle> and 
	 <wintitle>Daily Unique Visitors</wintitle> metrics on conversion reports
	 are limited to visits in which a conversion event (eVar instance or custom
	 event) occurred.
