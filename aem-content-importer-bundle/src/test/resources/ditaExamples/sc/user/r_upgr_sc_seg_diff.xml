    <refsyn id="refsyn_DD08C26C65E6425D85FC1529EEA31381">Most use cases should
		be resolved through 
		SiteCatalyst segmentation. Here are a few distinctions
		to be aware of: 
		<p><ul id="ul_C00C9386D0564277995C3B7945FB46B6"><li id="li_C1DE3BA8F2C049CDA5A63D31F156D39D">Interface 
			 <p>In 
				SiteCatalyst 15, the segment interface is
				identical to that of the 
				<wintitle>Advanced Segment Insight</wintitle> (ASI) builder. 
			 </p></li><li id="li_1166776E9778424B88648FFCA150B75A">Data Availability 
			 <p><wintitle>ASI</wintitle> processes from a specified date forward.
				Creating a segment for historical data is possible but time consuming. 
			 </p><p>SiteCatalyst 15 segments apply to all data on
				the new platform, as of your upgrade date. After you create a segment, you can
				immediately apply it in a report. 
			 </p></li><li id="li_C419C1EDFA8B41499C1A50D6A481E1B2">Processing vs. Filtering 
			 <p>ASI reprocesses data. This can cause some data
				discrepancies due to eVar persistence and similar factors. As such, 
				VISTA rules running on the 
				<wintitle>ASI</wintitle> report suite can change the data, rather
				than just filter out some traffic. 
			 </p><p>SiteCatalyst 15 segments act as filters at the 
				<wintitle>Visit</wintitle>, 
				<wintitle>Visitor</wintitle>, or 
				<wintitle>Page</wintitle> level. Rather than re-processing data,
				the filters remove data that falls outside of the criteria. As such, 
				<wintitle>VISTA</wintitle> rules cannot change the data in a 
				SiteCatalyst 15 segment. (If you need to
				re-process data after moving to 
				SiteCatalyst 15, contact Engineering Services.) 
			 </p></li><li id="li_96F326E941044CB79CBC9538F9B08438">Permissions 
			 <p>With 
				<wintitle>ASI</wintitle>, users can be restricted to see just one
				or more 
				<wintitle>ASI</wintitle> report suites, if needed. 
			 </p><p>Segments in 
				SiteCatalyst 15 do not allow any permissions by
				segment. A user can only see a segment if they have permission to see the
				report suite to which the segment applies.
