  <title>Breakdowns</title> 
  <shortdesc>Use breakdowns when you want to know more about how a report item
	 or segment relates to other reports. This is often called “breaking down” a
	 report by another report. A 
	 <term>breakdown</term> is the action of integrating two or more correlated
	 items (traffic reports) or two sub-related items (conversion reports).

	 <p>Two types of breakdowns exist: 
	 <table id="table_7A37601F79A440E98F3C968E91F2F86F">
		<tgroup cols="2"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1"
		  colwidth="1.00*"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="4.78*"/><thead>
			 <row>
				<entry colname="col1">Breakdown 
				</entry>
				<entry colname="col2">Description

			 </row></thead>
		  <tbody>
			 <row>
				<entry colname="col1">Traffic 
				</entry>
				<entry colname="col2">
				  <p> (Often called 
					 <term>correlations</term>) These are relationships between two
					 Traffic reports in a report suite. There are no standard correlations, because
					 only you know which reports you would like to correlate. An administrator can
					 set up relationships between the reports as needed. 
				  </p>
				  <p>An example of a correlation report is a breakdown of a custom
					 traffic report called Age Group, in which you have gathered site visitors’ ages
					 from a survey. This report allows you to see which age group is responsible for
					 the most traffic on your site. However, if you have gone to the trouble of
					 capturing something like the age of a visitor, you might want to know about
					 more than just page views. You can generate a breakdown report about which
					 search engine they use, what keywords they use, or where they are located
					 geographically. You are correlating the age group and the search engine. 
				  </p>
				  <p>If you break down a correlation report by 
					 <term>Referrer Type</term>, you might see a data point for 
					 <term>Inside Your Site</term>. This value indicates a referrer
					 page that is on the Internal URL Filters list. See 
					 <xref
					  href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=internal_URL_filter"
					  scope="external" format="http">Internal URL Filters</xref> in the Admin. 
				  </p>
				</entry>
			 </row>
			 <row>
				<entry colname="col1">Conversion 
				</entry>
				<entry colname="col2">
				  <p> (Often called 
					 <term>subrelations</term>.) These act the same as correlations,
					 allowing you to relate one report to another. However, they are set up a
					 differently on the back end. Instead of choosing two or more reports to hook
					 together, sub-relations are set up for a single report, which then can either
					 be broken down by everything or only by a few reports. 
				  </p>
				  <p>Full subrelations are enabled on all conversion reports, so
					 you can break down any eVar by another eVar. The 
					 <uicontrol>Breakdown By</uicontrol> menu in the report table
					 matches the standard Analytics reporting menu, keeping selections consistent 
				  </p>
				</entry>

	 </table>
	 </p> 
	 <p>By default, there are no correlations when you first implement marketing
		reports. However, there are two sets of reports and an additional report that
		are set up with subrelations enabled. You can break down these subrelation
		reports by every conversion report, because conversion reports have the
		conversion metrics in them, such as registrations, form completions, sign-ups,
		orders, revenue, and so on. 
	 </p> 
	 <p outputclass="head"> 
		<b>Traffic and Conversion Are Separate</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>You can break down a Traffic report into another Traffic report. You can
		break down a Conversion report into another Conversion report. However, Traffic
		report cannot be broken down by a Conversion report. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Traffic report breakdowns are multi-level. Meaning, you can break down
		up to 20 reports by each other. The only applicable metric for Traffic
		breakdowns is Page View. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Conversion report breakdowns are single-level. Meaning, you can break
		down only one Conversion Report by another. All conversion metrics are
		applicable to this type of breakdown report. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Correlations are available for all traffic variables, which enables you
		to break down any traffic variable by any other in variable traffic reports.?
