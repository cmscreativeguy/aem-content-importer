                <p>A report suite defines the complete, independent reporting on
					 a chosen website, set of websites, or subset of website pages. Usually, a
					 report suite is one website, but it can be a global segment where you have
					 combined several sites' numbers to get totals. Also, a report suite can be
					 smaller than a website, if want to run reports for a portion of your site. 
				  </p>
                <p>For example, if logged-in users and non-logged-in users use
					 your site differently, and you have different people looking at the reports for
					 each group, you can categorize report suites based on pages that require
					 authentication and pages that do not. 
				  </p>
                <p>When you log in, you select one report suite to use (except
					 when you use roll-ups that combine report suites).

                <p>A single web page that loads in a visitor's browser. A page
					 view is one execution of the JavaScript for that page. The system accurately
					 counts how many times a page is loaded, even if the visitor refreshes the page
					 frequently or uses the 
					 <uicontrol>Back</uicontrol> and 
					 <uicontrol>Reload</uicontrol> browser buttons. A page view
					 counts the entire page, not individual elements or hits.

              </entry>
              <entry>
                <p>A sequence of page views in a sitting. The visit ends only
					 after 30 minutes of inactivity or after 12 hours of continuous activity. (This
					 time measurement is the web analytics industry standard.) Visits are tracked by
					 cookies. A visit begins when a viewer accesses a page. A visit is sometimes
					 referred to as a 
					 <term>session</term>, but it is not a browser session. Going to
					 a different site, closing the browser, or even rebooting the computer does not
					 end a visit. 
				  </p>
                <p> If the inactivity time-out occurs while a visitor is reading
					 a page, the visit closes and is processed. A new visit starts when the visitor
					 clicks through to another page. 
				  </p>
                <p>If the date changes during a visit, such as when visiting a
					 site at midnight, the visit is attributed to the day on which the visit began.

                <p>Unique Visitor reports denote the number of different people

                <p>While one person might visit your site multiple times and

                  <b>Visitor De-Duplication</b>: Data collection de-duplicates
					 visitors based on the report title, independent of the calendar selection. For
					 example, a visitor that visits four separate days in a reporting week is
					 counted as one in the 
					 <wintitle>Weekly Unique Visitor Report</wintitle>. In a 
					 <wintitle>Daily Unique Visitors Report</wintitle> spanning that
					 week, the same visitor is counted four times.

              <entry>
                <p>Conversion events are the activities on your site that you
					 want people to do (key performance indicators). For an e-commerce site,
					 conversion events might be a detailed product view, a checkout, or a purchase.
					 For a lead generation site, the event might be a form completion. Conversion
					 events are counted on the site and have their own reports that show how many of
					 them happened. These events also become metrics to put in other reports and can
					 show why the conversion events happened, or what contributed to their
					 happening. 
				  </p>
                <p>The exception to the rule of one event becoming one metric is
					 the Purchase event, which spawns three metrics: Revenue, Orders and Units. 
				  </p>
                <p>More conversion metrics exist that are not defined here, but
					 conversion metrics form the foundation of your Web analytics, upon which other
					 metrics and reports are built.

					 <term>weather</term> and

					 for all page views that occur within any channel in your site.
