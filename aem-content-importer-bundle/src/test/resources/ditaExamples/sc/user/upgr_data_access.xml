  <title>Current Data </title>
  <shortdesc>The Include Current Data option on reports lets you view the
	 latest Analytics data, often before data is fully processed and finalized.
	 Current data displays most metrics within minutes, providing actionable data
	 for quick decision making.

    <p>Fully-processed, finalized data is typically available 45 to 120 minutes
		after receipt. 
	 </p>
    <p>The Include Current Data option is enabled by default for all users
		after you migrate. For more details, see 
		<xref href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/index.html?f=data_latency" format="https" scope="external">Include Current Data and Data Latency</xref>. 
	 </p>
    <!--<p>The data is processed in one-hour blocks. About 30 minutes after the end
		of an hour, data for that hour is visible. For the next hour, data is processed
		into a batch. As such, data availability oscillates between 30 and 90 minutes.
		This delay decreases with future releases of 
		SiteCatalyst.
	 </p>
    <p>In 
		SiteCatalyst 14, different types of data were
		available at different intervals. For example, traffic data was available to 
		SiteCatalyst reports in a 90-second delay, while
		conversion data was available in a 20-30-minute delay.
	 </p>
    <p>
      Marketing reports and analytics applies consistent data availability
		rules across all types of collected data. For example, in 
		SiteCatalyst 14 the 
		<wintitle>Page Views</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Visits</wintitle> metrics were updated at different times. This
		difference caused calculated metrics (such as 
		<wintitle>Page Views per Visit</wintitle>) to be overstated for the
		current day. All metrics and dimensions appear at
		the same time, providing a more consistent view of your metrics.
