				  trajectory.) 
				  <p>Here is the formula that is used to determine gainers or
					 losers: Real-Time looks at the earliest sample and the next-to-latest sample
					 and does a simple “% change” calculation. So if “Last 15 minutes" is selected,
					 and n represents the current minute, n-1 is compared to n-15. Real-Time does
					 not currently do any weighting. The current minute is ignored because it is not
					 complete and would likely produce a false % change. 
				  </p><p>This formula is consistent across all metrics used in the
					 real-time report.
