  <title> Targets</title> 
  <shortdesc>Targets let you measure your website performance and track
	 progress against target goals. For example, you might want to increase the
	 number of visitors that come from a geographic region, the revenue per order,
	 or the number of hits that come from a specific referrer.

	 <p>When you create targets, you select which attribute metrics or eVars you
		want to measure or you can choose to measure your entire site against your
		selected metric. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>For example, you can measure the number of unique visitors to your
		website, and use it as a target. In this case, choose the entire website.
		However, if you want to target the number of unique visitors to your website
		from Chicago, you can specify that eVar rather than look at your entire site.

						setting. For example, if your date range is the month of February, and your
						granularity selection is weekly, type a value for each week of the month of
						February. Target reports display for each granularity setting.
