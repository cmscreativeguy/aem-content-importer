	 <p> Visitor Click Map allows marketing reports &amp; analytics clients to
		visually measure traffic, conversion and success metrics within the pages of a
		web site. You can browse your site and see graphical information about how
		visitors are interacting with your content - superimposed over the pages of the
		site. Links on the page are highlighted. The greater the intensity of the
		color, the more frequently the item is clicked on. These metrics are overlaid
		on top of the page's links as a kind of 'heat map' to answer critical
		questions, including the following: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_FCA5EA97125A48C5982737176D87871A"> 
		<li id="li_09A902D4276A46069B818EB19249AC1F">What is the value of an
		  individual page? 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_021DC53AA1544FB7A76238346624956F">What is the value of an
		  individual element on a page? 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_7C5CD03504DC449EA05F681D9A4F00DD"> What is the most valuable
		  'digital real estate' on a page? 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>What do the "Loc #" and "Link Type" in the ClickMap report represent?
		The "Loc #" and "Link Type" data points help ClickMap identify the exact link
		on the page so that it can associate clicks to it correctly.
	 </p>
	 <p>Location is determined by the document.all() method in IE browsers.
		Every element on the page has a location number in the DOM (Document Object
		Model); document.all() returns the entire DOM, and the Adobe Analytics
		JavaScript code can then find the specific location of the element that was
		clicked. In any browser other than IE (Firefox, Safari, etc.), this value
		defaults to 0 because these browsers do not support the document.all() method
		in JavaScript.
	 </p>
	 <p>The Link Type data is determined by the type of tag that was clicked
		(e.g. anchor, image, Flash, area, button, etc.).
