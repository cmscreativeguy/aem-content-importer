  <title>Remove Duplicates from Merchandising eVars</title>
  <shortdesc>Previously, 
	 SiteCatalyst did not remove duplicate metrics for
	 merchandising eVars.

  <conbody>
    <p>For example, if two products share the same merchandising eVar value, a
		visitor that purchases both products in the same conversion event generated two
		
		<wintitle>Orders</wintitle> on the merchandising eVar. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      SiteCatalyst 15 removes duplicate metrics for
		merchandising eVars by counting multi-product orders using a single
		merchandising eVar as a single 
		<wintitle>Order</wintitle>. The result is a more accurate measure of
		orders associated with a particular merchandising eVar, but typically results
		in a drop in the 
		<wintitle>Orders</wintitle> metric when compared to previous 
		SiteCatalyst versions under the same circumstances.
