      <p>You read this report from left to right, beginning with the selected
		  page. The pages that were viewed after the selected page are illustrated as a
		  branch extending to the right. 
		</p>
      <p>The percentage that each subsequent page was viewed is displayed
		  beside the name of the page. The width of the line connected to each next-page
		  depicts this relative percentage. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <uicontrol>Path Views</uicontrol>: Indicates the number of times a page
		  was viewed, when constrained to the displayed paths. 
		</p>
      <p>For example, the Privacy Policy page could have 10,000 total page
		  views, but only 500 of those page views occurred immediately following the Home
		  Page. Thus, the term path view is used. 
		</p>
      <p>The relative percentage is depicted by the relative width of the line.
		  By default, this report displays five 2nd-level branches and five 3rd-level
		  branches. You can expand the number of branches to view up to ten 2nd-level
		  branches and five 3rd-level branches. Doing so increases the height of the
		  report and most likely requires scrolling to view the entire graph.
