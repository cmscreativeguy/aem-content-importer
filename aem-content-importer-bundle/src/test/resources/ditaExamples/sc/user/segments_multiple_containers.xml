      <title>Define containers in both the Include and Exclude
		  canvasses</title>
      <p>When using both the Include and Exclude canvas, you can obtain a much
		  more detailed set of data to report against. Data is processed using the
		  following sequence: 
		</p>
      <ol id="ol_3F468E081BB04B0088998656E8E8FA36">
        <li id="li_65A8A5337ED24E85BE03456760427BAE">Calculate what data is
			 included within the Include container. Any data that does not match this canvas
			 is ignored in the segmented report. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_F69C667908D2478CB72C9EA334E3B66E">Apply the exclude canvas
			 rules to the remaining data. Any data that matches these rules is ignored in
			 the segmented report. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_B192EA84BD8845FD92ED952C306142FD">The remaining data (that
			 matches the Include canvas and does not match anything in the exclude canvas)
			 is included in the resulting report.

      <title>Define multiple containers within a single canvas</title>
      <p>When dragging multiple segments adjacent to each other, they are
		  considered an "or" statement. All containers in the canvas are reviewed against
		  all data, and any data that matches any of the containers is included in
		  reporting. For example: 
		<ul id="ul_4F2176DC0DC54F6384332E36B353B589"><li id="li_DA5336FCFD194A31870AF10ED5EF2FDE">Visit container where
			 Country equals United States 
		  </li><li id="li_FF1C473E791D467DA860A5746F866CC3"> Visit container where an
			 order occurred 
		  </li></ul></p>

        <li id="li_1573EC5162E447F9BC223635578008F6"> It would then look at all
			 your data once again, this time searching to see if any image requests

      <title>Nest containers within each other</title>
      <p>When creating segment containers within other containers, you are in
		  essence creating a segment within a segment. The following logic is used with
		  nested containers: 
		</p>
      <ol id="ol_D9FA5C113E2D454FB3C6AC93BDF109A1">
        <li id="li_64619FDAAEC34065BD9688420EC5DED8">Determine what data is
			 included using the outermost container. Any data that does not match this outer
			 rule is discarded in the segmented report. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_6BD99C2A6D1E45BAB241869E0F994720">Apply the nested rule to
			 the remaining data. The nested rule does NOT apply to any hits that the first
			 rule throws out. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_53093231BF6340A3B8EDA08486EDFD49">Repeat until all nested
			 container rules have been calculated. The remaining data is then included in
			 the resulting report. 
		  </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can use nesting between containers as well as between rules within
		  a container. Here is what you can nest in each respective container:
