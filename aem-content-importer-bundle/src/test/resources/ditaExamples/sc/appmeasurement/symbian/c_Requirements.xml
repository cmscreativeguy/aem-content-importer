		<title>Symbian Device Library</title> 
		<p>The following files are required to use the AppMeasurement library on
		  Symbian devices: 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>AppMeasurement.h:</b> The Symbian C++ header file. This file can be
		  placed in your project folder. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>AppMeasurement.lib</b>: Library designed for use on the Symbian
		  device. Use this library for development and testing directly on the device,
		  and include it with your shipping application. During development we recommend
		  placing this file in the 
		  <filepath>C:\QtSDK\Symbian\SDKs\Symbian1Qt463\epoc32\release\armv5\urel</filepath>
		  folder.

		<p>When testing development using the Symbian Library, use the following
		  file in place of the AppMeasurement.lib file: 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>LibAppMeasurement.a: 
		  </b>Library designed for use with the Windows* Symbian emulator. Use
