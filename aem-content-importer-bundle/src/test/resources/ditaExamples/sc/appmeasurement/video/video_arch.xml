    <p>On the Web, JavaScript is added to pages on your site to enable
		measurement. Data is sent when a page is visited, or when a specific action
		occurs (for example, something is added to the shopping cart). The data sent by
		this code is analyzed by Analytics to determine the order pages were viewed,
		and how long viewers were on a particular page. 
	 </p>
    <p>Similarly, code is added to your video player to enable video
		measurement. For videos, data is sent when a video is started, closed, and at
		specific intervals or percentage-based milestones during video playback. To
		measure video, you add code (called the 
		media module) to your video player. The 
		media module is available in multiple formats to
		support a variety of video players. For example, the 
		media module is available in ActionScript for Flash,
		as a plug-in for OSMF, in .NET for Silverlight, and in JavaScript for other Web
		players (Windows Media Player, Quicktime, and others). 
	 </p>
    <p>If you have the source code for the player (for example, a custom OSMF
		player or a direct Flash NetStream implementation), you can compile the 
		media module directly into the player. For other
		players you can integrate using a plug-in interface or by using event handlers
		that are exposed by the player.
