		<p> One Custom Insight variable (s.prop) is also used for pathing. 
		</p> 
		<p>The variables you select for each metric are added to the video
		  configuration page. This lets the system automatically generate and format the
		  standard video reports. The video name evar and the video views counter are
		  both required. Other variables are optional but recommended for complete
		  measurement. After video tracking is enabled, you can view reports generated
		  from video data you have reported using video tracking. 
		</p> 
		<p>The required variables are described in detail in 
		  <xref
			href="video_config.xml#task_7EFCD616A99E4B39B7CF5CE43981C009/example_84C161113FB84DF9BE62CCF98375D506"
			type="example" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Video Variable Reference?></xref>.
		  
		</p> 
		<p>You can also track any number of additional metrics for video. For
		  example, if you use multiple video players on your site, you might populate an
		  evar with the player name. Some of the variables you select might also be used
		  in other areas of your site. For example, if used across your site, the content
		  type variable can let you measure what percentage of your page views are coming
		  from video and let you relate conversion events to video. 
		</p> 
		<note>The 
		  <uicontrol>Video Reporting</uicontrol> configuration page provides the
		  option to enable Video Solution Variables. Solution variables are used with the
		  newer 
		  <xref
			href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/hbvideo/"
			format="http" scope="external">heartbeat video</xref> tracking solution, and
		  are not compatible with the milestone video solution described in this
		  document. You can use this same configuration page to configure custom
		  variables to track milestone video as described in the task below.

					 <p>The default video data collection method collects data at
