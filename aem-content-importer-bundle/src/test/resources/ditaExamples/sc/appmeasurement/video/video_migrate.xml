      <title>About Integrated Video Tracking</title>
      <p></p>
      <p>Integrated video tracking collects video data using Custom Conversion
		  Variables (eVars) and Events. Using these variables to collect video data lets
		  you integrate video data with other reporting data on your reports (Legacy
		  pev3 video data was collected using a custom variable that prevented
		  integration). This change enhances your ability to analyze the impact of video
		  on other aspects of your on-line marketing strategy. 
		</p>
      <p>You can implement integrated video tracking on version 14 in
		  preparation for version 15 migration. Integrated video tracking can be
		  implemented on version 14 or later, and is required by version 15. 
		</p>
      <p>The following list explains how integrated video tracking is affected
		  as you migrate from version 14 to 15. 
		</p>
      <p>If you remain on version 14:

        <li id="li_57D58B89277143098B881E2BF1289E31"> You can use existing version 14
			 video implementation for existing version 14 reports. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_7414E404AE0C400EB84DDCE2FC4F81C2">You can upgrade video
			 implementation before moving to version 15. (To upgrade, contact your Account
			 Manager.) 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_472B10F51D3740B3A63C513849427771"> You will not have access
			 to any of the new version 15 features, video or otherwise. 
		  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you migrate to version 15 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_6729808A42F6473C92F53B2F4C6DC5CA">
        <li id="li_E2BBD585EF784EE99BA45FF223857AE3">To track/view any new
			 video data, you must re-implement video module. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_6B0ABD199C1C46DC97B12E86FC5CC5E1"> You can view previous
			 video data by logging into version 14, but after the upgrade to v.15, no video data
			 will be processed using version 14 platform. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_8259B81675C6483B8E14D5444A356B03">No integration of version 14
			 video data with new data collected in version 15.

			 require immediate re-implementation if moving to version 15, but re-implementation is
			 required for all new features.
