    <p>Based on the 
		<xref href="visit_example.xml#concept_E3B32B8E539F4FDC8E3FA872328B87BA" format="dita" scope="local">previous table</xref>, if you created a segment
		where visit number equals 9, it would include server calls 11 and 12. Even
		through server call 10 was technically part of the same visit, the historical
		data for that server call is not altered and the visit number remains
		unchanged.
