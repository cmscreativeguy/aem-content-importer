  <conbody>
    <p>Frequently, customers use the Adobe 
		<wintitle>Code Manager</wintitle> to replace their code with the most
		recent version. This practice is good to follow as long as you keep certain
		things in mind.

      <title>Using the Incorrect Data Collection Server ID</title>
      <p>Occasionally, generic 
		  <filepath>s_code.js</filepath> files that have not been generated from
		  Adobe Code Manager are sent to those implementing the code on your site. As a
		  result, the incorrect data collection server ID (as shown in the 
		  <wintitle>s.dc</wintitle> variable) for the account is used. It is best
		  to generate new code directly from the 
		  <wintitle>Code Manager</wintitle> for a specific report suite, rather
		  than reusing code from a different report suite. This is the best way to make
		  sure the 
		  <wintitle>s.dc</wintitle> variable is populated correctly.

      <title>Plug-ins</title>
      <p>Some customers implement plug-ins to enhance their Adobe experience.
		  When you replace your code, do not forget that you have plug-ins as part of
		  that code. The code created in the 
		  <wintitle>Code Manager</wintitle> does not have any plug-in code with
		  it, so all plug-ins need to migrate manually to the newer code base. Make a
		  copy of your existing code just in case something happens, and you need to
		  revert to your previous code.
