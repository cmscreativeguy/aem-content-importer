    <p>If the 
		<varname>pageName</varname> variable is not populated with a defined
		value (such as Home), 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> uses the URL of the page. Because the
		page name is central to your reports, make sure that all parties in
		your organization agree on a strategy before you implement. 
	 </p>
    <p>Depending on the content management system your site uses, it is helpful
		to add content elements to your system that can be used to populate 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> variables. Many companies find that most 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> variables can be populated from existing
		content management elements.
