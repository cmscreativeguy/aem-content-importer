    <p>Remote Scripts can be loaded synchronously or asynchronously. If you are
		loading frameworks, such as jQuery, that you want to use throughout the page,
		we recommending loading these scripts synchronously. This ensures that any
		functions defined are available to other elements on the page. 
	 </p>
    <p>Functions and other code defined in script tags cannot be used in the 
		<codeph>&lt;head&gt;</codeph> element on the page since that loads before
		the page code.
