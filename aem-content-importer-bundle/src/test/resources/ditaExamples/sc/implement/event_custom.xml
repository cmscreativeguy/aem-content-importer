  <title>What is a Custom Event?</title>

	 want to track.

    <p>Although similar to 
		<wintitle>predefined</wintitle> events, 
		<wintitle>custom</wintitle> events let you define your own success
		metric. For example, if you have a newsletter, your success event could be
		"Registration." Clearly, "Registration" is not part of the 
		<wintitle>predefined</wintitle> events. By using a 
		<wintitle>custom</wintitle> event, you can track the number of visitors
		who register for your newsletter. 
		<wintitle>Custom</wintitle> events follow the standard syntax shown
		below. 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.events="event3"</codeblock>
    <p>The code above shows how to assign an event to the 
		<varname>events</varname> variable. If you do not modify the event name
		in the interface, then "event3" would display in the interface. 
	 </p>
    <p>By default, success events are configured as "counter" events. Counter
		events count the number of times a success event is set. Some success event
		uses require an event be incremented by some custom amount. These events can be
		set either as "<wintitle>numeric</wintitle>" events or
		"<wintitle>currency</wintitle>" events. You can change the event type using Admin Console.
