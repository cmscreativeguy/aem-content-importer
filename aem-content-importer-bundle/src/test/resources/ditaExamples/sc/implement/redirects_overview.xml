  <title>Redirects and Aliases</title>
  <shortdesc>Redirects point the browser to a new location without user
	 interaction. They are executed at either the web browser (client-side redirect)
	 or at the web server (server-side redirect).

    <p>Because redirects do not require any user interaction, redirects are
		often executed without the user ever noticing. The only thing that indicates a
		redirect has occurred is the browser's address bar. The address bar displays a
		URL that is different from the link the browser initially requested. 
	 </p>
    <p>Although there are only two types of redirects, they can be implemented
		in numerous ways. For example, client-side redirects can occur because the web
		page to which a user has pointed his or her browser contains scripting or
		special HTML code that redirects the browser to another URL. Server-side
		redirects can occur because the page contains server-side scripting or because
		the web server has been configured to point the user to another URL.
