  <title>maxDelay</title>
  <shortdesc>The s.maxDelay variable is used primarily in Genesis DFA
	 integrations to determine the timeout period in contacting the DFA host. If
	 Adobe does not receive a response from DFA's servers within the specified
	 period set in the 
	 <varname>s.maxDelay</varname> variable, the connection is severed, and data
	 is processed normally. Implement this variable if you are concerned with DFA's
	 response time on each page. It is recommended to experiment with this value to
	 determine the optimum timeout period.

      <li id="li_70BBFC950F0840E1AE21BBD6BC10A825">This variable is an optional
		  event metric populated via the JavaScript implemented on your site.

      <li id="li_08426A40DDC247998203E1E8DC6ABCB0">If the DFA host does not
		  respond within the given amount of time, the event designated to Timeout runs
		  (assigned via the Genesis integration wizard).

      <li id="li_868B7E9A8F5B46CC86377E5899E0C10A">This variable can only
		  contain a numeric value.

      <li id="li_49ED06E086C044D58367CFC40D772171">Increasing the wait time
		  collects more DFA data, but also increases the risk of losing 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> hit data.
		  <p>Losing 
			 <keyword>Analytics</keyword> hit data would occur when the user
			 navigates away from the page during the 
			 <varname>s.maxDelay</varname> period. 
		  </p></li>
      <li id="li_ED353F64DD7B484C9B384BB8125E11B6">Decreasing the wait time
		  will lower the risk of losing 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> hit data, but can reduce the amount of
		  DFA data sent with hit data.
		  <p>Losing DFA integration data would occur when the 
			 <varname>s.maxDelay</varname> period does not accommodate enough time
			 for the DFA host to respond.
		  </p></li>
    </ul>
    <note>Adobe does not have control over DFA's response time. If you are
		seeing consistent issues even after raising the max delay period to a
		reasonable time frame, consult your organization's DFA account administrator.
