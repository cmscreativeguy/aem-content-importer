  <title>Variables and Values</title>
  <shortdesc> Ensure that the variables that are populated from server
	 scripting or code cannot output any quotation marks that interfere with the
	 values. 
  </shortdesc>
  <prolog>
    <metadata>
      <othermeta name="solution" content="Analytics" />
      <othermeta name="topic" content="Developer and implementation" />
    </metadata>
  </prolog>
  <conbody>
    <p> For instance: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.pageName="Article: "Article Name""
s.pageName='Company's Information'
</codeblock>
    <p>Ensure that the values of the variables do not exceed their maximum
		limits, specified in this document. Additional characters are cropped at the
		data collection servers. They may interfere with the total length, increase
		bandwidth unnecessarily, and may cause other issues. 
	 </p>
    <p>Do not use $, ™, ®, ©, or commas (,) in the products variable.
		Generally, these are not useful in any 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> variables and may interfere with the
		ability to interpret or export fields. The best practice is to limit characters
		to the first 127 ASCII characters. 
	 </p>
    <p>Ensure that the events variable is populated with an appropriate value
		(<wintitle>prodView</wintitle>, 
		<wintitle>purchase</wintitle>, 
		<wintitle>scAdd</wintitle>, 
		<wintitle>scRemove</wintitle>, 
		<wintitle>scOpen</wintitle>, or event1-event5) whenever 
		<varname>products</varname> is populated. Ensure that the case of all 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> variables and functions are maintained,
		as shown below. 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.pageName
s.server
s.channel
s.pageType
s.prop1 – s.prop20
s.campaign
s.state
s.zip
s.events
s.products
s.purchaseID
s.eVar1 – s.eVar20
var s_code=s.t();if(s_code)document.write(s_code)//--&gt;
</codeblock>
    <p>Page names are case sensitive, and differences create additional page
		records. "Home" and "home" are two different pages within 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword>. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note> Multiple page records cannot be combined within 
		  reports. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>Validate that links are reported in the 
		<wintitle>Custom Links</wintitle> report. Ensure that the correct
		parameters are passed to the 
		<wintitle>tl</wintitle> function. For more information on 
		<wintitle>custom links</wintitle>, see
