  <conbody> 
	 <p>Because the browser strips referring URL, you must configure the
		mechanism that handles the redirect (for example, the web server, server-side
		code, client-side code) to pass along the original referrer information. If you
		would also like to record the alias link URL, this must also be passed along to
		the ultimate landing page. Use the 
		<varname>s_pageURL</varname> variable to override the current URL. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Because there are many ways to implement a redirect, you should check
		with your web operations group or your online advertising partner to identify
		the specific mechanisms that execute redirects on your website.
