  <title>Enabling Pathing on a prop</title> 
  <shortdesc> Though pathing reports are available out-of-the-box for pages,
	 pathing can also be enabled for 
	 <wintitle>custom traffic</wintitle> variables.

	 <p>Enabling pathing on a prop can be done in the Admin Console. The
		following list contains few examples of a business question that can be solved
		by enabling pathing for a prop. 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_A8885988C25F4D0BA1D77374EC201716"> 
		<li id="li_8FCEDBF4881C45D9999B7B7753D6434B">Where does a user go on my
		  site after they come to my site from a campaign? 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_4B0DD24352724270828475C7548B3DE1">What are the common site
		  sections my users go to in their visits?

		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>Advanced pathing is available in 
		<keyword>Ad hoc analysis</keyword>. Ad hoc analysis provides segmentation
		on any report on the fly without needing to enable this setting, or structure
		data in the prop in certain ways. It is the easiest and most optimal way to
		segment your path reports as well. For more information see the 
		<xref href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dsc/"
		 format="http" scope="external">Ad hoc analysis documentation</xref>.
	 </p> 
	 <p>When pathing is enabled for a prop, you get a new set of pathing reports
		that are found below the standard pathing reports. Pathing reports tell you the
		order that it saw the pages come in for that visitor. When you enable pathing
		on a prop, it does the same thing: it tells you the order of the prop values it
		saw come in for the user. This order of values is displayed in different ways
		depending on the path report you are viewing.
