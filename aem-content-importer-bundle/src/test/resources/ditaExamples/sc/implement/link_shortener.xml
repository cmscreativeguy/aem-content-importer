  <title> Links from URL Shorteners</title> 
  <shortdesc>Links from URL shortener services (such as bit.ly) are typically
	 not tracked as page views or as referrers. These services return 301/302
	 redirects with the full URL to the web browser, which then sends a new,
	 separate request to the full URL. The original referrer is preserved since the
	 shortener is no longer in the loop, and there isn't an indication on the
	 request that a redirect service was used to get the URL.

		specific scenarios in use on your site to determine the redirect mechanism used
		by the service.
