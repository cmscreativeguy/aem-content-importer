  <title>Tag Processing Order</title>
  <shortdesc> By default, most tag management tags are executed asynchronously.
	 This provides a number of performance benefits, since your page continues to
	 load while tags execute. However, there are some cases where you need to load
	 and execute a tag synchronously, such as with an implementation of Adobe
	 Target. Synchronous loading was added as an option in tag management 2.0 to provide
	 for this use case.

  <conbody>
    <p>When a page loads, tag management inserts all synchronous tags defined in a
		tag container at the location of the page code, which should be placed directly
		after the opening 
		<codeph>&lt;body&gt;</codeph> tag.

    <p>These synchronous tags are executed in order in the main processing
		thread. Asynchronous tags are executed in separate threads, and multiple
		asynchronous scripts might be executed in parallel depending on the browser.

    <p> For example, in the previous diagram, synchronous tag 1 executes before
		synchronous tag 2. Asynchronous tags can be executed in any order, depending on
		how long they take to execute and the processing architecture of the browser.
		In the previous diagram, asynchronous tag 2 might complete before asynchronous
		tag 1, but might complete after synchronous tag 2.

      <title>Product Tag On Load</title>
      <p>Each product tag provides an 
		  <uicontrol>On Load</uicontrol> section in the UI. Code placed in this
		  section is executed after the tag loads. 
		</p>
      <p>If you need more control over tag execution, you can also execute code
		  based on tag events. See
