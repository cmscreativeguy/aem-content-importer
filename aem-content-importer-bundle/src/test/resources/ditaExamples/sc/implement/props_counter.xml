    <p>You can use a prop to count the number of times an event occurs. For
		example, you want to track the use of the Real Player vs. the Windows Media
		Player on your site. Each page contains 
		<wintitle>Code to Paste</wintitle>, in which you can see 
		<wintitle>s.prop</wintitle> variables. Use 
		<wintitle>s.prop</wintitle> 1 to track the players. For page A, enter a
		value in 
		<wintitle>s.prop</wintitle>1 to represent Real Player. 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop1="RealPlayer"</codeblock>
    <p>For page B, enter a similar value in 
		<wintitle>s.prop</wintitle>1 for Windows Media Player, as shown below. 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop1="WindowsMP"</codeblock>
    <p>
      <note> Adobe offers up to 75 
		  <wintitle>s.prop</wintitle> variables for you to use. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>As visitors come to your site and visit the pages containing the Real
		Player or Windows Media Player, 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> is able to segment the users based on
		which pages they visited. The 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> report then shows the number of
		visits to each page. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note> The name of the 
		  <wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> report can be customized. For
		  example, the 
		  <wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> report can be renamed to "Player
		  Types Report."
