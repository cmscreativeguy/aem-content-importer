	 <p> If you look at the 
		<xref href="visit_example.xml#concept_E3B32B8E539F4FDC8E3FA872328B87BA"
		 format="dita" scope="local">previous table</xref>, this occurred 3 times: at
		hits 1, 9, and 10. This occurs because the effective 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> is the same for both server calls, and
		occurs even though the visits might be several hours apart and on different
		devices. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>This can increase the number of unique visitors you see when
		cross-device visitor identification is enabled. The visitor might be counted
		twice on the same visit: once for the initial visit and again after the user is
		authenticated. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>When a new visitor views your site, the 
		<codeph>s_vi 
		</codeph>cookie is populated and stored. On the data collection server, a
		new visitor profile is created for this visitor ID, and the effective 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> on the profile is set to match the
		cookie. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> When cross-device visitor identification is enabled, if a 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> variable is provided in a subsequent hit
		(for example, after authentication), the effective 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> is updated to match the custom value.
		This can cause the effective 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> to change directly after authentication,
		resulting in multiple visitor counts.

	 <p>After the initial association, visit counts return to normal because the
		visitor is associated through the 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> cookie. If the visitor later views your
		site and then authenticates, the visitor count is not inflated because the
		effective 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> doesn't change after authentication.
