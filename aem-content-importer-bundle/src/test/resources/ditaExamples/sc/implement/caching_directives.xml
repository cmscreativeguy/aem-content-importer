    <p> Adobe customers should ensure that their Web servers are set up to take
		advantage of this functionality. For example, make sure that the NO-CACHE
		setting is set to false. Additionally, ensure that the expiration date is
		sufficiently long. Make sure any proxy caches are set up with the correct
		configuration. The customer's Web server documentation provides more
		information.
