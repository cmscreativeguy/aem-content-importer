    <p>To answer this question, you need to set aside an 
		<wintitle>sprop</wintitle> to be used for this report. You then need to
		structure the data to populate into the prop in such a way that it makes sense
		when pathing is enabled. 
	 </p>
    <p>For this example, you are going to use 
		<wintitle>prop1</wintitle> as your campaign pathing prop. Now you want to
		populate this 
		<wintitle>sprop</wintitle> with the same value you put in the 
		<wintitle>page name</wintitle> variable. See below: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop1=s.pageName;</codeblock>
    <p>You should do this on all pages unless the person has clicked from a
		campaign. If they have clicked from a campaign and are on the landing page of
		the campaign, then you populate the prop with a concatenation of the campaign
		and the 
		<wintitle>pagename</wintitle>. See below: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">	s.prop1=s.campaign + ‘ : ’ + s.pageName;</codeblock>
    <p>If the campaign they clicked was named "banner1234," and the page it
		landed on was named "Home Page," the value in that prop would be "banner1234 :
		Home Page." On every subsequent page you put the 
		<wintitle>pagename</wintitle> in the prop as shown above. 
	 </p>
    <p>When a user clicks this campaign and views four total pages in that
		visit, you get the following values in the sprop in this order: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">“banner1234 : Home Page” &gt; “Page 2” &gt; “Page 3” &gt; “Page 4”</codeblock>
    <p>With our data captured in 
		<wintitle>prop1</wintitle> in this way, with pathing enabled on this
		prop, you can now look at one of various pathing reports to understand how they
		path through the site after they click from a campaign. 
	 </p>
    <p>You can specify the start page from which to start the path report. In
		this case, you selected "banner1234 : Home Page", because you want to know
		where users went after they clicked from campaign "banner 1234." This report is
		only an example of one of many path reports.
