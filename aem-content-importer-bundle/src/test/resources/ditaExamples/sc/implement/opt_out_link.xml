	 <p> If a user chooses not to be tracked and an opt-out cookie is set, your
		JavaScript file will continue to send data to Adobe servers but that data will
		not be processed or reported on. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The collection_domain section of the URL structure is the trackingServer
		used in your JavaScript file. The collection domain used for your Adobe
		Analytics implementation can be seen in the DigitalPulse debugger in the first
		row of the Adobe Analytics table, which is labeled either “First Party Cookies”
		or “Third Party Cookies” depending on your implementation. The collection
		domain for your website may contain 2o7.net, omtrdc.net or your website domain,
		such as metrics.example.com. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Visitors opt-out by clicking the link on the opt-out page, thereby
		causing a cookie to be set in their browser. By having the 
		<codeph>omniture_optout</codeph> cookie for the applicable tracking
		domain, the user's activities will not be reported by Adobe Analytics. You can
		provide your own link to the opt-out cookie, or you can follow the steps below
		to set the opt-out cookie. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Adobe offers opt-outs for all implementation types. You are responsible
		for your own privacy policy and for remaining in compliance with your signed
		terms. Note that the link to the opt-out page changes based on your
		implementation type, as outlined here. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If you implement Adobe Analytics products and services with cookies set
		on domains owned by Adobe (i.e. 207.net or omtrdc.net), you can point your
		website visitors to the opt-out mechanism provided in the 
		<xref href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html" format="http"
		scope="external">Adobe Privacy Center</xref> for all sites that use Adobe
		cookies for Adobe Analytics products and services. The direct link to the Adobe
		opt-out mechanism is http://collection_domain/optout.html.
