	 <p>The Integrate Module is a great way to integrate partners into the Adobe
		data collection process. However, requesting partner data to include in Adobe
		data collection can introduce delays in the data collection process and
		increase the risk of losing visitor data.

		  servers.Potential data-loss occurs when a visitor leaves the page during the
		  delay introduced by the request for partner data. Because the Adobe Web beacon
		  (image request) is delayed, SiteCatalyst cannot capture any data about that
		  visit.<b>NOTE: To minimize the risk of data loss, Adobe applies a 250ms time
			 out value (default) to the receipt of data from external sources. If external
			 data, such as a JSON object from a partner, does not arrive within this
			 timeframe, the Adobe Web beacon proceeds without the partner data.</b>
