  <title>Counting Content Hierarchies</title>
  <shortdesc> A common usage of 
	 <wintitle>content hierarchies 
	 </wintitle>is to show the different paths visitors have taken from a
	 certain page, level, and so forth.

    <p> How Should I track my 
		<wintitle>Content Hierarchy</wintitle>? You must first understand the
		reporting requirements for tracking 
		<wintitle>content hierarchies</wintitle>. If the requirements for
		tracking the hierarchy are very detailed, often times the hierarchy (hier)
		variable is recommended. Hierarchies usually require a strict, pre-defined
		taxonomy where the same child node rarely lives under multiple parent nodes.
		Consider the following example: 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <wintitle>Global Hierarchy</wintitle>
    </p>
    <p> All Sites &gt; Regions &gt; Countries &gt; Language &gt; Category 
	 </p>
    <p> In this example, the hierarchy could begin to break down at the
		language level. If a requirement is to report on overall "English" traffic, you
		can run into the problem where English appears under USA, England, Australia,
		and so forth. Hierarchies allow you to only drill down. In order to slice
		horizontally across multiple hierarchies, the best practice is to use a 
		<wintitle>custom traffic variable</wintitle> (prop). 
	 </p>
    <p> If you want to provide users with the ability to drill down through the
		site (similar to how users would browse the site) and report on 
		<wintitle>Unique Visitors</wintitle> at each level of the hierarchy, the
		hierarchy variable is recommended. 
	 </p>
    <p> There are occasions when using both props and the hier variable makes
		sense. The following is a supported prop for each variable type:
