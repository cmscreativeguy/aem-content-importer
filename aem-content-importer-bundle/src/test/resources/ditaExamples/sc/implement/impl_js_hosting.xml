  <title>JavaScript File Location and Concurrency</title>
  <shortdesc> Placing the call to the JavaScript library file at the top of the
	 page ensures that the 
	 image is among the first elements to be
	 downloaded.

    <p> Most Web browsers download images concurrently. Typically three to four
		images can be downloaded simultaneously. 
	 </p>
    <p>Because most Web browsers download elements concurrently, the Status Bar
		of many common browsers (including Internet Explorer) does not accurately
		reflect which element the browser is trying to load. For example, your Status
		Bar may report that your browser is waiting for image 1 to download. The
		network packet tests show your browser has already received image 1 and is
		currently waiting for image 2. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note> Because third-party Internet Performance Audit providers (such as
		  Keynote Systems) download page image elements sequentially, not concurrently,
		  they do not mimic the typical user experience.
