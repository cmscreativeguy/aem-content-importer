  <title>Moving from Section to Section</title>
  <shortdesc> If you want to know how visitors move from section to section on
	 your site, you first need to ensure that you are tagging your sections with the
	 
	 <varname>channel</varname> variable.

  <conbody>
    <p>With this data in place, you must have pathing enabled on the 
		<varname>channel</varname> variable. If a user starts on the home page
		and moves to the Sports section, then to the News section, this activity shows
		up in the 
		<wintitle>Site Section</wintitle> path reports. These reports display
		after pathing is enabled on this variable.
