	 <p> This feature works by associating the visitor profiles across each
		device where a user is uniquely identified. After association, the visitor
		profile records are merged and visits from each device are considered to be
		from the same user. This feature allows campaigns from one device, such as a
		mobile device, to receive credit from conversion events made from another
		device, such as a desktop. This feature is commonly referred to as 'visitor
		stitching'. 
	 </p> 
	 <note type="important">Cross-Device Visitor Identification fundamentally
		alters how Adobe Analytics identifies unique visitors and attributes success
		events. Read this section throughly to fully understand the impacts to
		determine if this functionality is right for your unique implementation and
		business requirements.

		<title>How Visitors are Counted without Cross-Device Visitor
		  Identification</title> 
		<p>With the increasing number of devices used by the same visitor, it can
		  be difficult to accurately gauge unique visitors and correctly attribute
		  first-touch marketing channels. For example, a potential customer clicks a link
		  in a marketing email and views your site for the first time: 
		</p> 
		<image href="graphics/first_touch.png"
		 id="image_23E686D7A0084379930803CA61B8308C" placement="break"
		 align="center"></image> 
		<p>This customer is considered a unique visitor and the first-touch email
		  channel is incremented. The next day, this same customer visits your site from
		  a laptop at his office: 
		</p> 
		<image href="graphics/first_touch_channel.png"
		 id="image_7ADB320C82CC41B6A78200D8045782EE" placement="break" align="center"> <?xm-replace_text Paragraph?>
		</image> 
		<p>Since the device is new, the customer is considered a unique visitor
		  and the first-touch direct channel is incremented. A few days later, this same
		  customer visits from a mobile device: 
		</p> 
		<image href="graphics/visitor_3.png"
		 id="image_C3809B274BD443B891BCEC78A5931F0C" placement="break"
		 align="center"></image> 
		<p>The customer is again treated as a unique visitor.
