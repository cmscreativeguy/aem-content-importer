    <p>For example, a visitor went to page A, then page B, then page C. Pathing
		is one of the very powerful features of 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword>. The tremendous insight it brings is
		critical to businesses looking to understand visitor traffic patterns.
	 </p>
    <p>Out-of-the-box 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> provides pathing at the page level. The
		basic idea behind pathing is you are shown the order of pages that users saw
		during their visits. This data is presented in several different reports that
		format the data in different ways, depending on what you are trying to see.
