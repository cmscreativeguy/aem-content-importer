    <table id="table_18913E19D61143A28AB170D1492B8A0C">

        <thead>

          <row>
            <entry> Case-Sensitive 
				</entry>
            <entry> The parameter names (<varname>pageName</varname>, 
				  <varname>purchaseID</varname>, and so forth) are case-sensitive
				  and will not properly record data unless they appear as designated in the table
				  displayed in 
				  <xref href="query_parameters.xml#concept_2F280ECF4205465FA9B5D773046C1A15" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Query Parameters?></xref>.

          <row>
            <entry> Encode Query Parameters 
				</entry>
            <entry>
              <p> The values for each of the query string parameters must be
					 URL encoded. URL encoding converts characters that are normally illegal when
					 appearing in a query string, such as a space character, into an encoded
					 character beginning with %. For example, a space character is converted into
					 %20. 
				  </p>
              <p>The JavaScript version of this function is called escape (and
					 to decode, unescape). Microsoft IIS Version 5.0 also includes an Escape and
					 Unescape function for encoding query strings. Other Web server scripting
					 languages also provide encoding/decoding utilities.

          <row>
            <entry> Maximum Variable Length 
				</entry>
            <entry> Each variable has a maximum length. This length is
				  specified for each variable in 
				  <xref href="sc_variables.xml#concept_E10E43221A2740FAAF900B79CE1EC5FB" format="dita" scope="local">Analytics Variables</xref>. Exceeding the maximum
				  length for a variable causes the value of this variable to be truncated for
				  storage and display in 
				  <keyword>Analytics</keyword>.

          <row>
            <entry> Invalid Characters 
				</entry>
            <entry> Characters with character codes above decimal 128 are
				  invalid, as are not-printing character codes under 128. HTML formatting
				  ("&lt;h1&gt;") is also invalid, as are trademark, registered trademark, and
				  copyright symbols.

				</entry>
            <entry>
              <p>On pages that are accessed via https (secure protocol), the
					 URL portion of the image request changes to accommodate a different set of data
					 collection servers.

              <p>The following table illustrates the different URLs used for
					 secure and non-secure image requests.

				  <wintitle>Request ServerVariables</wintitle> (URL) (IIS/ASP), or
				  the appropriate variable for your server/scripting technology. The referring
				  URL (<wintitle>r=</wintitle>) is extremely important for tracking referring
				  URLs, domains, search engines, and search terms. 
				  <p> If

					 If neither

					 <wintitle>Current URL (g=)</wintitle> is populated, the record

            <entry> Effects of Caching 
				</entry>
            <entry>
              <p>HTML and other Web pages can be cached by browsers or servers
					 that are between the visitor and the website that is serving the content.
					 Caching prevents an accurate count of page views and other events unless a
					 "cache-busting' technique is employed. 
				  </p>
              <p> Adobe's standard JavaScript includes a dynamic method of
					 changing the image request to avoid page and image caching, allowing an
					 accurate count of page views. 
				  </p>
              <p>However, in creating a server-side image request, this
					 randomization does not occur. Page reloads and cached pages (either in the
					 browser's cache or in a proxy server) are not counted in certain cases when
					 using server-side image requests. 
				  </p>
              <p>SSL (https:) pages are not, by definition, ever cached so this
					 warning applies only to non-secure (http:) pages. Additionally, pages with
					 parameters
					 (<filepath>http://www.samplesite.com/page.asp?parameter=1</filepath>) or
					 certain file extensions (<filepath>.asp</filepath>, 
					 <filepath>.jsp</filepath>, etc.) are also not cached. 
				  </p>
              <p> The examples below also illustrate a minimal JavaScript
					 solution that primarily assembles the image request server-side, and tacks on a
					 random number in the browser. This method overcomes the caching that would
					 otherwise be encountered on static HTML pages accessed via the http: protocol.
