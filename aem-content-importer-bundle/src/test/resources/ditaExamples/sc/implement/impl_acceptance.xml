    <p>The following steps outline the implementation process. 
	 </p>
    <ol id="ol_042175031D1F41FB80E8D59E93D6DFB7">
      <li id="li_81E4D10446B54C39AAECBEE2A46EF476">The Adobe Consultant gathers
		  report requirements and creates a data collection plan based on those
		  requirements. 
		  <p>The data collection plan includes variable definitions, required
			 VISTA rules and custom JavaScript, data correlation, and all 
			 settings for each report suite. The
			 client completes the Implementation Questionnaire. 
		  </p></li>
      <li id="li_F498A42F73774C949CE0246A95BBF26D">Technical resources on the
		  client-side implement the code, site-specific JavaScript, and server-side
		  variables. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_394A714BE1154DA29CA5B5581681194E"> The Adobe Consultant
		  addresses technical issues during the implementation and assists in devising
		  solutions as required. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_D8527B80BFE2425F89D6F1DEA122D934"> Technical resources on the
		  client-side unit test the implementation. 
		  <p>Testers log in to 
			 <keyword>Analytics</keyword> and verifying all variables
			 (<varname>page name</varname>, 
			 <varname>channel</varname>, 
			 <varname>server</varname>, 
			 <varname>events</varname>, 
			 <varname>campaign</varname>, econversion variables, custom traffic
			 variables, 
			 <varname>products</varname>, and all other 
			  variables). 
		  </p></li>
      <li id="li_CED19C8752F041C6BBE948254C8FB182">The client notifies Adobe
		  that the implementation is complete.
		  <p> The client provides a validation sample (data sample) to the Adobe
			 Consultant to validate data accuracy. (VISTA-generated report suites are
			 validated by comparing appropriate metrics. A client-Adobe agreement of the
			 metrics to be validated for such report suites shall be made in advance, at the
			 time of the VISTA rule creation.) 
		  </p></li>
      <li id="li_8A48C0D654CC41FCA0F2736A7BED735D">The client faxes (or signs
		  online) an Implementation Acceptance and Agreement for the appropriate site(s).
		  
		</li>
      <li id="li_14369496F0774EFDBC9ED0674A6247EB">After the acceptance has
		  been received, the Adobe Consultant enables the Adobe Best Practices -
		  Implementation Verification certification within the interface. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_FE35DB95E9454D8B9F1C77D02EE6E472">Optionally, the client can
		  contract with Adobe for monitoring services for key pages of the implemented
		  site (generally, these are the primary templates, home page, and critical entry
		  pages). 
		  <p>This monitoring software is described in a separate document, but
			 tracks pages by loading and executing the page, then comparing the 
			  image request to a baseline stored in
			 a database. If any differences are detected, the software notifies specified
			 Adobe (AM/IE) and client personnel via email.

      <li id="li_7FFA065A01A24B0084DE3903DBA13143">A best practices document,

      <li id="li_A595196096394985A94C00F34876B663"> The validation document

      <li id="li_240A5FE645E74C1DB8BBACBA6E70DDC2"> Utilities and/or tools for
