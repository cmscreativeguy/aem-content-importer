  <title>Instances on Merchandising Variables</title> 
  <shortdesc>Describes how instances are counted on merchandising variables.

  <conbody> 
	 <p> Instances are not currently counted for merchandising variables that
		use Product Syntax. If you have selected Product Syntax and have implemented
		according to these directions, you should not see instances for this variable.
		If instances are being counted, it indicates that the eVar is being set in some
		locations outside of the products string, which is unnecessary. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If you are using Conversion Variable Syntax, an instance is counted each
		time the variable is set. However, the instance is attributed to "None" unless
		the following occurs each time the variable is set: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_63A447D114E2480B9DE1311D585E235E"> 
		<li id="li_3BBA2CFBEE8548CA8667F26DF76A2CFB">A binding event is set. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_F1250AAE4EAE4CC8AD255EF296E97102">The products variable is
		  set. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_3B23CB8633AF4F7695E3662CFED5CC6F">The merchandising eVar has a
		  value. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>For example, the following instance of eVar1 is allocated to
		"Outdoors:Ski Goggles": 
	 </p> 
	 <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.eVar1="Outdoors:Ski Goggles"
s.events="prodView"
s.products=";Fernie Snow Goggles"</codeblock> 
	 <p>However, in the next example, the instance of eVar1 is allocated to
		"None" since all conditions are not met when the eVar is set (there is no
		binding event and the products variable is not set): 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Page 1 of the visit: 
	 </p> 
	 <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.eVar1="Outdoors:Ski Goggles"</codeblock> 
	 <p>Page 2 of the visit: 
	 </p> 
	 <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.events="prodView"
s.products=";Fernie Snow Goggles"</codeblock> 
	 <p>Allocation to "None" occurs if you set a value for an eVar on a page
		where no binding event occurs, or if you set the eVar value in the products
		string without a binding event. 
	 </p> 
	 <note>The current functionality for counting instances on merchandising
		variables is being reviewed and is scheduled to change in an upcoming release.
