  <title>Mobile Protocol Network Gateway</title> 
  <shortdesc> When a mobile device requests a page from a Web server, the
	 request is sent through a gateway, which converts the mobile request (usually
	 in the WAP or I-Mode protocol) into an HTTP request that is sent to a Web
	 server.

	 <p> When a mobile device requests a page from a Web server, the request is
		sent through a gateway, which converts the mobile request (usually in the WAP
		or I-Mode protocol) into an HTTP request that is sent to a Web server. The Web
		server responds to the gateway, which forwards the request to the phone. This
		gateway acts much like a standard proxy server. The gateway does, however, pass
		the user agent string of the mobile device on to the Web server. This lets the
		Web server respond with a page that is built specifically for the device
		requesting it. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Because screen size on WAP mobile devices is so limited, mobile pages
		are very light, often containing only text and one cached image. When the image
		tag is added to the pages, a request is sent on every page for an image from
		Adobe servers. When the image, a WBMP, is returned, Adobe servers instruct the
		browser not to cache it. Consequently, the image is requested again on
		subsequent pages. The random number described above should be used to protect
		against browsers that do not obey the Adobe no-cache directives.
