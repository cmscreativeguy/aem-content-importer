    <p> You can determine the best way of populating the 
		<varname>pageName</varname> variable by looking at the structure of
		your website. The methods listed below outline various ways of populating the 
		<varname>pageName</varname> variable. 
	 </p>
    <p>While the 
		<varname>pageName</varname> variable is central to identifying user
		behavior, Adobe recommends using multiple variables to indicate page
		information. The best page naming strategies use a different variable for each
		level of hierarchy within your site, as shown below: 
	 <ul id="ul_7170DF0ADF664AC0ACC71B99C59FEC86"><li id="li_43EB516F708842919E5428B007DBCA62">The 
		  <varname>channel</varname> variable can be used to indicate the site
		  section. 
		</li><li id="li_B10A8DB8818B4A63A34751A05836820B">The 
		  <varname>pageName</varname> variable can be used to show content
		  type. 
		</li><li id="li_E045B275789C426AADD4C8D0AEDB6612"> A 
		  <wintitle>custom insight</wintitle> variable (prop1) can be used for
		  detailed content. 
		</li></ul></p>
    <p>Levels of detail vary, depending on property, as shown below:

    <p>The more layered your site, the more variables should be used to
		identify page content. Companies also find value in allowing for overlap
		between variables. For example, a more detailed variable may contain
		information not only about the product being viewed, but also about the site
		section and sub-section. This is particularly helpful when a product or article
		appears in more than one section of the site. 
	 </p>
    <p>The following page naming strategies describe how to populate the 
		<varname>pageName</varname> variable. While it is tempting to choose
		the page naming strategy that is easiest to implement, the page naming strategy
		largely determines the usability of all 
		<wintitle>Path</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Page</wintitle> reports. Use good judgment when deciding how
		pages are named.

      <title>Unique Name for Each Page</title>
      <p>The most valuable method of naming pages is to give each page a unique
		  identifier that is easily understood by all 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> users in your organization. Examples of
		  page names include Home Page, Electronics Department Home, and Sports : Local
		  Sports : High School. 
		</p>
      <p>Most 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> users find that hierarchical page names
		  are useful in both identifying where the page is found on the site and its
		  purpose. The following table shows some sample page names for various
		  industries:

      <title>File Path (Not the Full URL)</title>
      <p>For some sites, the file path is clear and easily read. Any business
		  user can read a URL and determine the page to which the file path refers. If
		  this is the case for your site, you can use a server-side variable to populate
		  the path to the file into the 
		  <varname>pageName</varname> variable, as shown below: 
		</p>
      <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.pageName="&lt;%= file_path %&gt;"</codeblock>
      <p>Adobe does not recommend leaving the 
		  <varname>pageName</varname> blank, (which results in using the full
		  URL of the page) even though you may be tempted to do so. The following
		  side-effects are caused by leaving the 
		  <varname>pageName</varname> variable blank and using the 
		  <varname>pageURL</varname> as the page identifier. 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_5E1AA3F19DBD49078E94FDC1E7780B84">
        <li id="li_197636E210F6418993D8B1E9897E79A8">The domain and path of a
			 page may not always be displayed identically. For example, the following four
			 URLs return a single page: 
			 <ul id="ul_AECC7829295B4E6EBDCFAE8D331885EC"><li id="li_686F32FC881A4B66B94539C3D9F31865"><filepath>http://www.mysite.com/index.jsp</filepath></li><li id="li_FCE030219C3C44C995C6BC1E731E022E"><filepath>http://www.mysite.com</filepath></li><li id="li_CF342888ABC248FC90569DB45D355AB9"><filepath>
					 http://mysite.com/index.jsp</filepath></li><li id="li_209728041D374193BFAA026DA77E9DC6"><filepath>http://mysite.com/</filepath></li></ul><p>If the 
				<varname>pageName</varname> is left blank, each of these page
				names would occupy a separate entry in 
				reports. 
			 </p></li>
        <li id="li_E5A85F0C78AD4DD5B07B42A1F80C3D1B"> Some pages (such as
			 forms) post to themselves, thereby erasing any distinction between the original
			 form and the resulting output. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_F581C89A17164AE69288F499D11A156D">When your page is
			 translated into another language by search engines or other online tools, the
			 URL of the page is the URL of the search engine (not the URL of your site). 
		  </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="section_B99B8F66B0E2410FA7BFE44E6851EB3F">
      <title>HTML (document.title)</title>
      <p>If you have invested time into making your HTML titles readable and
		  intuitive, you might consider using the same title as the value in the 
		  <varname>pageName</varname> variable. Adobe recommends using a
		  server-side variable to populate the 
		  <varname>pageName</varname> rather than using JavaScript's 
		  <filepath>document.title</filepath>. Some browsers interpret the HTML
		  title differently than others, which may cause 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> to receive different page names from
		  different browsers. 
		</p>
      <p>The best practice for using the HTML title is to copy the existing
		  titles for each page into a separate variable or content management element.
		  When you decide to make changes to the HTML title for search engine
		  optimization or other purposes, the 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> page names are not affected. If a page
		  name changes in 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword>, it becomes a new page and is not
		  connected with the old page name, regardless of the associated URL.
