    <p>Typical compression algorithms can reduce the size of the JavaScript
		file by 40-60% or more.

    <p>
      <note> Not all browsers support all file compression standards or
		  interpret the compressed files in the same manner. Adobe does not guarantee
		  reliable file compression in all environments. Customers should test
		  compression in their supported browsers and configurations before deploying.
