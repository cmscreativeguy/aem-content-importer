		<title>Fallback Visitor Identification Method</title> 
		<p>AppMeasurement for JavaScript 1.x and JavaScript H.25.3 (released
		  January 2013) contain a new fallback visitor identification method for visitors
		  whose browser blocks the cookie set by Adobeâ€™s data collection servers (called 
		  <codeph>s_vi</codeph>). Previously, if a cookie could not be set,
		  visitors were identified using a combination of the IP address and user agent
		  string during data collection. 
		</p> 
		<p>With this update, if the standard 
		  <codeph>s_vi</codeph> cookie is unavailable, a fallback cookie is
		  created on the domain of the website with a randomly generated unique ID. This
		  cookie, named 
		  <codeph>s_fid</codeph>, is set with a 2 year expiration and is used as
		  the fallback identification method going forward. This change should result in
		  increased accuracy in visit and visitor counts in situations where the primary
		  cookie (<codeph>AMCV_</codeph> or 
		  <codeph>s_vi</codeph>) cannot be set. 
		</p> 
		<p> Visits total includes all visitors that are identified by the 
		  <codeph>s_vi</codeph> cookie or by using a fallback method.
