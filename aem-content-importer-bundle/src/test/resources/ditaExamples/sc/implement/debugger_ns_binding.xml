  <title>NS_Binding_Aborted in Packet Monitors</title>
  <!--kb10639-->
  <shortdesc>The 
	 <uicontrol>NS_BINDING_ABORTED</uicontrol> message is often seen on 
	 <wintitle>custom link tracking</wintitle> image requests with packet
	 sniffers that sit on top of the browser, such as Tamper Data or HTTPFox .

  <conbody>
    <p> This error occurs because the link tracking image request is designed
		to let the browser proceed to the next page before waiting for a response from
		the Adobe data collection servers.
	 </p>
    <p> Adobe's response to the image request is simply a blank 1x1 transparent
		image, which is not relevant to the content of the page. If you see a line item
		in your packet monitor from Adobe, either with a 
		<uicontrol>200 OK</uicontrol> response or an 
		<uicontrol>NS_BINDING_ABORTED</uicontrol> response, the data has reached
		our servers. There is no need to have the page wait any longer.
	 </p>
    <p> Packet monitors integrated as a plug-in rarely see the full response.
		They tend to see the request as aborted because the full response was not
		received. These monitors also rarely make a distinction between whether it was
		the request or response that was aborted. A stand alone packet monitor
		typically has more detailed messages and reports the status more accurately.
		For example, a user may get a message in 
		<i>Charles</i> saying "Client closed connection before receiving entire
		response." This means the data did reach our servers, just the browser moved on
		to the next page before the 1x1 pixel was received.
	 </p>
    <p> If an external packet sniffer is reporting that the data collection
		request is aborted, rather than the response, this is a cause for concern.
		Adobe
