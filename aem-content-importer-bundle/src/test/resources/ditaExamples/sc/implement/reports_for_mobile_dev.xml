  <title>Reports for Devices Using Mobile Protocols</title> 
  <shortdesc> Because mobile devices are tracked via a beacon, just like other
	 visitors, most reports are available and correct.

		<title>Search Engines, Search Keywords, Referring Domains, and
		  Referrers</title> 
		<p>These reports only have data if the referrer is populated in the image
		  request sent from the mobile page. The referrer is populated via the "r" query
		  string parameter, as outlined in the Implementing without JavaScript white
		  paper. You must also manually pass the referrer information into the image
		  request. 
		</p> 
		<p>The ‘r’ query string parameter must include the protocol of the
		  referrer. If the protocol is left off, the referrer report is not populated.
		  For example, use 
		  <codeph>r=http://msn.com</codeph> not 
		  <codeph>r=msn.com</codeph>.

		<title>Geosegmentation and Domains</title> 
		<p> Geosegmentation reports are based on the IP address of the device
		  sending the request. Because mobile devices rely on a gateway to request images
		  from Adobe servers, the gateway's IP address is used to determine the
		  geo-location of the user. Because gateways and their IP addresses are
		  registered for large networks, the associated geo-location is often less
		  accurate. 
		</p> 
		<p> Domains are also based on the IP address of the gateway, which means
		  the domains report often contains the name of the carrier who owns the gateway.
		  Due to Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), this may not be accurate.

		<title>Connection Types</title>
		<p>Adobe maintains a known range of IP addresses that belong to mobile
		  carriers. When a hit is received from an IP range that belongs to a known
		  mobile carrier, the hit appears as "Mobile Carrier" on the Connection Type
		  Report. Otherwise, mobile traffic is listed under "Lan/Wifi".

		<title>Time Zones, Cookies, Java, JavaScript, Monitor Colors and
		  Resolutions, Browser Width and Height, and Netscape Plug-ins</title> 
		<p>These reports are all collected by using JavaScript to detect specific
		  settings of the browser. Because JavaScript is not used to create the image
		  beacon on mobile devices, data collected from mobile users is not included in
		  these reports.
