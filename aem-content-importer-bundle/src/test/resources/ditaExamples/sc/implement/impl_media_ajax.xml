  <title>AJAX-Tracking Rich Media Applications</title>
  <shortdesc>
    <wintitle>AJAX</wintitle> is an emerging concept in web design that uses
	 multiple technologies to create and manage dynamic content on Web pages.

    <p>The need to track user interaction with 
		<wintitle>AJAX</wintitle> and other rich media applications is paramount
		to analytics success and realization of the return on investment in the Web
		design. The focus of this white paper is to provide recommendations for
		tracking rich Internet applications, specifically those that use 
		<wintitle>AJAX</wintitle>.

      <title>Rich Internet Applications (RIA)</title>
      <p>Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) are changing the face of the Web.
		  They bridge the gap between the promise of on-demand technologies for the
		  masses and realistic user experiences. RIAs have been maturing for years. The
		  biggest leaps forward have occurred with wide-scale adoption of browsers, which
		  support the underlying technologies that power these applications. While RIA
		  has many forms and supporting technologies, the most common, and perhaps most
		  widely adopted, are AJAX and Flash. It is important to understand that the
		  technology is not what defines an RIA, but its usability and application.

      <title>What to Track</title>
      <p>One of the most commonly asked questions with RIA is how to track
		  micro-level activity separate from macro-level activity, and when it is
		  appropriate to do either. For example, say you have an application that allows
		  customers to uniquely configure a product. The application may have significant
		  steps the users are exposed to. Are these steps considered page views? In
		  addition, there are micro-level activities within each step. Should these
		  activities be tracked as page views? 
		</p>
      <p> What if you want to understand the flow between activities, or which
		  features get the most activity? The trouble with RIA is that each application
		  is unique. They are designed to mimic realistic actions, and since actions are
		  relative to the situation, the possibilities are endless. However, most
		  applications have a few major components: milestone steps, features, and
		  micro-level actions within features. So, while each application requires some
		  consideration as to what specifically should be measured, there are some
		  generalizations that can be applied to RIA tracking. 
		</p>
      <title>Macro-Level Activity</title>
      <p>Macro-level activity usually constitutes the loading of the
		  application. This provides information on visits, visitors, instances, value to
		  future actions, and so forth. It can, and should, also represent major steps in
		  the process. A good rule of thumb is that if an RIA action changes the
		  application more than 50% (or whatever is considered significantly changing the
		  user experience or content), then it is macro-level, and should be tracked as a
		  page view. 
		</p>
      <title>Micro-Level Activity</title>
      <p>Micro-level activity includes any changes less than 50% (or not
		  considered as significantly changing the user experience or content). Toggling
		  between color selections, for instance, would be considered micro-level
		  activity. Adobe recommends that micro-level tracking be related to features.
		  For example, in the case of toggling between colors, is it really important to
		  understand which colors were considered? Or is it more important to know that
		  the color selection feature was used? Perhaps both are important, and if so,
		  capture both, but when measuring the effectiveness of RIA, consider the feature
		  level activity as being more valuable. 
		</p>
      <p>All micro-level activity should be tracked as custom links with
		  specifics measured through associated traffic variables (props and eVars if the
		  use needs to be measured against success events). This ensures that page views
		  are not inflated by micro-level activity, and allows for path analysis through
		  the traffic variable. 
		</p>

      <title>What to Analyze</title>
      <p>It is important to understand how effectively your RIA is driving
		  success. Success is most commonly measured through conversions. A macro-level
		  analysis provides insight into RIA effectiveness as a whole. Micro-level
		  analysis may provide insight into which features help drive conversion. 
		</p>
      <p>You should measure efficiency of your RIA. This is an analysis of
		  micro-level activity relative to the RIA macro metrics. Do users go through
		  more steps than necessary to arrive at the same goal? Analysis metrics might
		  include visits/features activity; page views/feature activity, visitors/feature
		  activity, and so forth. 
		</p>
      <p>Conduct analysis on path flow and fall out. Are users avoiding the RIA
		  and finding another path to the goal? Run 
		  fallout reports built around the site
		  and RIA flow. Run path analysis from landing pages to gauge the true traffic
		  patterns. Look at barriers and incentives to guide users toward the goal.
