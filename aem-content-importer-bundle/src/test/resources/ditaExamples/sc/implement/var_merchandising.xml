	 <p>When measuring the success of external campaigns or external search
		terms, you typically want a single value to receive credit for any success
		events that occur. For example, if a customer clicks a link in an email
		campaign to visit your website, all purchases made as a result should be
		credited to that campaign. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>But what about events that are driven by internal search or by category
		browsing when a customer is looking for multiple items? For example, a customer
		searches your site for "goggles" and then adds a pair to the cart:
	 </p><image placement="break" align="center"
	 href="graphics/merch-example-goggles.png"
	 id="image_3355D1B005A04C7491701FDE437FD082"></image>
	 <p>Before checkout, the customer searches for "winter coat", and then adds
		a down jacket to the to the cart:
	 </p><image placement="break" align="center"
	 href="graphics/merch-example-coat.png"
	 id="image_D2EBCD9409EC44DCB07F5EA9F2A0697E"></image>
	 <p>When this purchase is completed, assuming the allocation wasn't changed
		from Most Recent, you'll have an internal search for "winter coat" credited
		with the purchase of a pair of goggles. Good for "winter coat", but bad for
		marketing decisions:

	 <p><b>How merchandising variables solve this problem</b>
	 </p>
	 <p>Cross-category merchandising variables, or "merchandising evars", let
		you assign the current value of an eVar to a product at the time a success
		event takes place. This value remains tied to that product, even if one or more
		new values are later set for that particular eVar.
	 </p>
	 <p>If merchandising is enabled for the eVar in the previous example, the
		search term "goggles" is tied to the Fernie Snow Goggles, and the search term
		"winter coat" is tied to the El Gordo Down Jacket. Merchandising variables
		allocate revenue at the product level, so each term receives credit for the
		amount of revenue for the product to which the term was associated:
