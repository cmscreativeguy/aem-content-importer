  <title>Segmenting Paths by User Type</title>
  <shortdesc> Segmenting paths by user type is a common request for trying to
	 understand how specific user types path on your site.

    <p>You can concatenate the user type and page name into a 
		<wintitle>sprop</wintitle> and enable pathing on the 
		<wintitle>sprop</wintitle>. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, let's say you have two user types: "Registered" users and
		"Non-Registered" users. You need to distinguish between these two user types on
		each page and put these values into your designated 
		<wintitle>sprop</wintitle>. When you populate the prop, it should display
		as shown below: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">	s.prop1=”Registered : “ + s.pageName;</codeblock>
    <p>If the user is a registered user and visited the home page, the value in
		the prop displays as follows: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">	“Registered : Home Page”</codeblock>
    <p>If they click to another page named "Page 2", the value on that page
		displays as follows: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">	“Registered : Page 2”</codeblock>
    <p>With 
		<wintitle>Pathing</wintitle> turned on, you see those two values in
		succession. If you want to know how registered users move from the home page,
		find the value "Registered : Home Page" in one of the path reports and see the
		next pages they visited. In this case, they next went to "Page 2."
