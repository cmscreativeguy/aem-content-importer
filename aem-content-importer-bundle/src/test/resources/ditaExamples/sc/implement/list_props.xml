  <title>List Props</title> 
  <shortdesc> List props are a delimited list of values that are passed into a
	 variable, then reported as individual line items. List props are most commonly
	 implemented on pages that contain user-selectable values, such as listed items
	 with check boxes or radio buttons. They are useful in any circumstance where
	 you want to define multiple values in a variable without sending multiple image
	 requests.

	 <p>A prop can be changed into a list prop on the Admin Tools &gt; Report
		Suite &gt; Traffic Variables page by enabling List Support and then selecting a
		delimiter. Popular delimiters are colons, semi-colons, commas, or pipes. The
		delimiter can technically be any of the first 127 ASCII characters.

		<title>Implementation Examples</title> 
		<p>When you request enabling of list props, indicate the delimiter that
		  you would like to use. After the 
		  <varname>s.prop</varname> of your choice is enabled, multiple values
		  can be set in the variable as shown in the following examples: 
		</p> 
		<p>A list prop delimited by a pipe, passing in two values: 
		</p> 
		<codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop1="Banner ad impression|Sidebar impression"</codeblock> 
		<p>A list prop delimited by a comma passing in several values: 
		</p> 
		<codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop2="cerulean,vermilion,saffron"</codeblock> 
		<p>List props can also be sent with a single value: 
		</p> 
		<codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop3="Single value"</codeblock> 
		<p>The delimiter can be changed at any time. However, the implementation
		  must match the new delimiter. Failure to use the correct delimiter results in
		  the list prop value being treated as a single concatenated line item in
		  reporting. 
		</p> 
		<p>Because a list prop is still a Traffic Variable, it is subject to
		  Traffic Variable limitations. List props are limited to 100 bytes of data and
		  are affected by case sensitivity settings.
