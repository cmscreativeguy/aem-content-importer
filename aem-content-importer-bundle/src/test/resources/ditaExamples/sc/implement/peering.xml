    <p>Peering is simply the agreement to interconnect and exchange routing
		information without the need of the public network. Please contact Adobe
		Engineering if an ISP is interested in establishing a peering relationship.
	 </p>
    <p>Although peering may provide some benefits to Adobe ISP customers,
		optimizing the HTML snippet and the Web servers caching directives likely have
		a much greater impact. High-volume ISP customers realize the most benefit from
		peering.
