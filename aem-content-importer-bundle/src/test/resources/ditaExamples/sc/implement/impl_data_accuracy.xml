  <title>Data Accuracy Validation</title>
  <shortdesc> Data accuracy validation is a process of comparing 
	 report data with known and verifiable data
	 points.

  <conbody>
    <p>The validation process should be completed by Adobe personnel,
		preferably by the Adobe Consultant (the person most familiar with the technical
		implementation details). 
	 </p>
    <p>The preferred data points for this validation, in order of preference,
		are listed as follows: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_93C7BCD4C3984FAE94EEC1FD79F88412">
      <li id="li_CAD52633B6944A8695FCFE95B9853CA1"> (Econversion sites)
		  Comparison of econversion orders for a single day. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_91BAB3992A5D487AAF91EE134212ACF2">Comparison of known success
		  events, especially logged data where IP address and other browser information
		  generally stored in web server logs can be compared to the data collected. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_AF91FFB558A44E32A36F50C99779BC2D"> Comparison of page views.
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <note>Default pages, such as 
		  <filepath>index.html</filepath>, often receive automated or monitoring
		  traffic. These pages represent a greater difference to browser-based data
		  collection than other visited pages.
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>All three types of validation require a debug log or data feed for the
		time period in question. This is generally one day or less. 
	 </p>
    <p>It is expected that orders or success events can be measured to within
		2-3% of actual values (sometimes reaching higher accuracy levels) using
		standard JavaScript-based implementations. This assumes an SSL page, since SSL
		pages are cached much less frequently, and by definition they should not be
		cached. An implementation with fully server-side image requests on an SSL page
		should come within about 0-1% of actual values. Non-secure pages may experience
		higher differences, but still within 5% of actual values. 
	 </p>
    <p>When comparing page views for a single time period, it is expected that
		the page views can be accounted for within 5% of actual values, not including
		monitoring (such as Keynote or WhatsUpGold) or automated traffic (spiders,
		bots, and scripts). 
	 </p>
    <p>Data accuracy comparisons need to take into account the following items:
		
	 <ul id="ul_C01CE79CC2EC4BD297F3A11B68A0AF5D"><li id="li_874ECF1DE34B4E6E99140C9F28BDDD46">QA or other types of
		  internal testing that may be filtered by IP addresses or VISTA rules. 
		</li><li id="li_A87FE9CC3B274D68850D3D6F38858CC4"> Smart tags that only
		  generate tags for certain types of orders or traffic. 
		</li><li id="li_D5A442E3395743A8A345F034FEB02117"> Queries for comparison must
		  take into account what is being measured by the website (not including returns,
		  orders placed by customer service personnel, or other special conditions). 
		</li><li id="li_BB5B3D39AF4D40699D6ECCF84E7DFEB6"> Ensure that the time zone
		  differences between the query and the 
		  report suite match. 
		</li><li id="li_A21A7947DBC945BAA44808164E3B4CF2">Custom Keynote or similar
		  traffic (Keynote Transaction, etc.) that measure the ordering process and may
		  be reflected in tags, but removed from ordering systems. 
		</li><li id="li_CAE8DCEA8DCD4F6DBB9E14147280F6BD"> Account for the client's
		  de-duping processes. 
		</li><li id="li_79651ACA650B4B82B741A09A33F35645">Reloads of the order page
		  (Orders are de-duplicated based on 
		  <varname>purchaseID</varname>). 
		</li></ul></p>
