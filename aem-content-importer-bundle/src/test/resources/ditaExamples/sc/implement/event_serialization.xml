  <title>Event Serialization</title> 
  <shortdesc> Event serialization is the process of implementing measures to
	 prevent duplicate events from entering Analytics reporting. This can commonly
	 occur when a user refreshes the page multiple times, navigates to a certain
	 page multiple times, or saves the web page to their computer (for example, if a
	 customer saves a purchase confirmation page to their computer, every time they
	 view it orders and revenue would be counted again if event serialization was
	 not in place).

		<wintitle>Event serialization</wintitle> is useful in the following
		instances:

	 <ul id="ul_BC8656CBC8044751A866D81C318B65BB"> 
		<li id="li_8A49C9796EC2430CAAEF329CBDB45A01">A page may be reloaded or
		  refreshed and repeatedly send an event. 
		  <wintitle>Event serialization</wintitle> prevents events from being
		  recounted by using a serial number for each event. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_25006700B8374ED995471247582510B8">The user saves the page to
		  his/her machine for later review. This scenario is quite common on purchase
		  confirmation pages to review purchase receipts. 
		  <wintitle>Event serialization</wintitle> prevents the subsequent page
		  reloads from re-counting the events. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>This document describes the process to implement 
		<wintitle>Event serialization</wintitle> for 
		<wintitle>conversion</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>custom</wintitle> events. To use 
		<wintitle>Event serialization</wintitle>, you must first contact Adobe
		Live Support to have it enabled.

		<title>Default Behavior</title> 
		<p>The default behavior is to count each instance of an event. An event
		  is set for each 
		  <wintitle>pageview</wintitle>that is counted, even on page reloads or
		  page refreshes. The 
		  <wintitle>s.purchaseID</wintitle> variable is used in order to uniquely
		  identify each order (purchase). This allows a user to reload the order page
		  without recounting the order, revenue, or products. A similar feature is
		  available for all events. This includes pre-defined events such as 
		  <wintitle>prodView</wintitle> and 
		  <wintitle>scCheckout</wintitle>, as well as all custom events.
