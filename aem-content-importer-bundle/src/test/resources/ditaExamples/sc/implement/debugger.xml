  <title> Adobe Debugger</title> 
  <shortdesc>The Adobe Debugger (previously DigitalPulse Debugger) is a free
	 tool provided by Adobe that lets you view the data being collected from your
	 site on any given page.

  </prolog> 
  <conbody> 
	 <note>DigitalPulse debugger was recently moved from 
		<codeph>digitalpulse.omniture.com</codeph> to 
		<codeph>adobetag.com</codeph>. If you are having issues using the
		debugger, copy the updated code from 
		<xref href="debugger_install.xml#task_8DB4DB56982C4EB6B599F99B02A9AD3B"
		 format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Installation?></xref> and update
		your bookmarklet. 
	 </note> 
	 <p>When executed in your browser, it shows the image requests that
		transmitted data from that page into Marketing Cloud solutions, along with any
		variable values or parameters that were captured. This allows you and your
		developers to check the validity of your implementation on any page on your
		site. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The 
		<keyword>DigitalPulse Debugger</keyword> is officially supported for use
		in all recent versions and builds of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft
		Internet Explorer, and Safari. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<note>Because the 
		  <keyword>Debugger</keyword> functions by creating a pop-up window when
		  you access a special bookmark in your web browser, certain ad-blocking plug-ins
		  and pop-up blockers might interfere with the loading of the 
		  <keyword>Debugger</keyword>.
