  <title>Traffic props and Conversion eVars</title>
  <shortdesc>
    <wintitle>Custom traffic</wintitle> variables, also called props (s.prop)
	 or 
	 <wintitle>property</wintitle> variables, are counters that count the number
	 of times each value is sent into 
	 <keyword>Analytics</keyword>.

  <conbody>
    <p>Props also let you correlate custom data with specific traffic-related
		events. These variables are embedded in the 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> code on each page of your website.
		Through 
		<wintitle>s.prop</wintitle> variables, 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> lets you create custom reports, unique to
		your organization, industry, and business objectives. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, if you are an automobile manufacturer, you may be
		interested in seeing "Most Popular Car Model" to complement your "Pages"
		report. You can accomplish this by allocating one of your traffic properties to
		represent car model. Then implement your code to pass in car model on the
		appropriate pages. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note>
        <keyword>Analytics</keyword> supports up to 75 
		  <wintitle>s.prop</wintitle> variables. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>Props are used in pathing reports or in correlation reports. For
		example, 
		<wintitle>property</wintitle> variables can be used to show content type,
		sub-section, or template name. The resulting 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> reports show which content type,
		sub-section, or template is viewed most often. 
	 </p>
    <p>There are endless business questions that can be answered through the
		custom traffic variables, depending on what you are capturing from your
		website. The following list contains a few common goals and objectives: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_9D22C9B46DDA4B60859D3903E8210E62">
      <li id="li_18E996180B9B45DA93EB3BDC9765436E"> Understanding user
		  navigation through the website 
		</li>
      <li id="li_A402F2621A6148C583C015145C33D74E">Understanding internal user
		  search behavior 
		</li>
      <li id="li_1B2011C40AEE49898AEAD3EBE1158409"> Segmenting traffic by
		  navigation or category 
		</li>
      <li id="li_6B2ABB7974624EECB94355A33ADC1F39"> Segmenting visitor behavior
		  by demographics 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>eVars (or 
		<wintitle>Custom Conversion Insight</wintitle> variables) are used to
		identify how well specific attributes or actions contribute to success events
		on your site. For example, for a media site, eVars may be used to identify how
		well internal promotions bring visitors to register. When a visitor clicks on
		the internal promotion, an eVar can be used to store a unique identifier for
		that promotion. When the same visitor completes registration and a custom
		success event is fired, the original unique identifier receives credit for the
		registration event. 
	 </p>
    <p>In a conversion site, eVars may be used to track how logged-in visitors
		compare to non-logged in visitors in completing a purchase. When a visitor logs
		in, an eVar is set to "logged in." When that visitor reaches the checkout page,
		the checkout event is attributed to the "logged in" value. When a visitor
		reaches the Thank You page after purchasing, the products and purchase amounts
		are attributed to the "logged in" value. The resulting 
		<wintitle>Custom eVar</wintitle> report shows the total number of
		checkouts and orders for "logged in" and "non-logged in" visitors.
