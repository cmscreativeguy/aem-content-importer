  <title>Geo-Segmentation Data</title> 
  <shortdesc> Geo-Segmentation data is recorded based on the first hit of the
	 visit, and does not change for a single visit regardless of the device used.

  <conbody> 
	 <p> If a customer browses your site from his or her home computer, and then
		from a mobile device within 30 minutes, the Geo-Segmentation data is not
		changed. If you are using VISTA to populate an eVar with Geo-Segmentation data,
		it is based on the IP address in each hit. This could result in multiple
		Geo-Segmentation data values if the IP address changes for the same visit.
