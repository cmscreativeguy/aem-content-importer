	 <p>When you provide a 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> variable with a hit, the system checks
		for any other visitor profiles that have a matching 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle>. If one exists, the visitor profile that
		is already in the system is used from that point forward and the previous
		visitor profile is no longer used. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> is typically set after authentication, or
		after a visitor performs some other action that enables you to uniquely
		identify them independently of the device that is used. We recommend creating a
		hash of the username or an internal ID that does not contain any personally
		identifiable information.

		 format="dita" scope="local">previous example</xref>, after the customer signs
		on from each device, they are all associated with the same user profile. If the
		visitor later signs out on a device, stitching continues to work since the 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle>s that are stored in a cookie on each
		device are already associated with the same visitor profile. We recommend
		populating the 
		<wintitle>s.visitorID</wintitle> variable whenever possible in case the 
		<wintitle>visitor ID</wintitle> cookie is deleted.

		<p>After authentication on the laptop, hits with either visitor ID
		  (<codeph>nv1</codeph> or

		  Analytics. However, visitor de-duplication is not retroactive, so 2 unique
		  visitors are counted.
		</p>
		<p>On the first data connection on the mobile device the customer is not
		  recognized so a new unique visitor is counted. Once the user is authenticated
		  (<codeph>cust1</codeph>) on the mobile device, Adobe Analytics maps 
		  <codeph>cust1</codeph> back to the visitor ID provided on the main
		  site, so no more unique visits are incremented.
		</p>
		<p>Each new device or browser authenticated will add 1 unique visitor.
