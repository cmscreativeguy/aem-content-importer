	 <note>Shared Marketing Cloud folders and assets are mirrored to the
		Creative Cloud desktop in a 1:1 relationship. If a Marketing Cloud user changes
		a folder (deletes, adds, or removes sharing), the action is mirrored in the
		Creative Cloud desktop and web. As such, if a folder is unshared, the folder
		and assets are deleted from your local machine. After sharing is removed, the
		folder and its contents are moved to the trash can on your local computer,
		where you can manually restore them to your machine.
