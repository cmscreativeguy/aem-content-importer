		<title>Synching the Customer ID with your Analytics
		  Implementation</title> 
		<p> When a visitor authenticates on your website or otherwise identifies
		  himself, you must expose that person's CRM customer ID to your 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> implementation. This synchronization
		  stores that visitor's CRM customer ID in the Marketing Cloud, and activates
		  that customer's attributes for use in the Marketing Cloud. 
		</p> 
		<p> For example, assume that Bob has Customer ID 
		  <codeph>52mc210tr42</codeph> in your CRM system. When Bob authenticates
		  on your site, you must expose this ID on the page, and use the ID to
		  synchronize it by one of two means: 
		</p> 
		<ul id="ul_8B68699F5E214285B84FE325E5F30524"> 
		  <li id="li_2217FA2514724CCD86FE146D4E49DC3D">Call 
			 <codeph>visitor.setCustomerIDs({"crm_id":"52mc210tr42"})</codeph>
			 using the Visitor ID service. 
			 <p>Or, 
			 </p> 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_5D96F2DCB10C48BF8B8079F1F3D20FEA">Populate the 
			 <term>Customer ID (52mc210tr42)</term> in a prop or eVar. 
		  </li> 
		</ul> 
		<p> The Customer ID must be set on each 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> server call where the Customer ID is
		  known. 
		</p> 
		<note>(For beta only.) Each customer ID uploaded to the CRS will likely
		  have multiple visitor IDs in Analytics. Adobe has decided that if a customer ID
		  has more than 500 unique visitor IDs, we will not process any of that customer
		  ID's data into Analytics. If you store the customer ID in a prop or eVar, you
		  can see the IDs that fall into this category by running the appropriate report
		  and adding the Unique Visitors metric.

					 <p>Why is it preferable to use the Visitor ID service to set
						the Customer ID instead of populating the Customer ID in a prop or eVar?

				  <entry colname="col2"> 
					 <p>Using the Visitor ID service offers a number of benefits:

						<li id="li_BA2EF0715C5A47EFAFA7191CFAD088A4">If you do not
						  set the Customer ID with the Visitor ID service, the customer records are
						  available only to Adobe Analytics. If you want to use the customer records for
						  real-time targeting, you must use the Visitor ID service. 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_228358684E474A298E39578D427BF932">Using the
						  Visitor ID service to set the Customer ID reduces the time it takes to
						  synchronize IDs with the Marketing Cloud. If you put the Customer ID in a prop
						  or eVar, the Customer IDs are sent to the Marketing Cloud via back-end server
						  synchronization that occurs in batches. The Visitor ID service synchronizes the
						  Customer ID with the Marketing Cloud immediately. 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_BCF28219E4014FCF9F747C3D8D270526"> Using the
						  Visitor ID service instead of a prop or eVar frees up that prop or eVar for
						  other uses. 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_2264FA91BF88411D8481449AB884F050">We need to test
						  the Visitor ID service with customer attributes during the beta test to ensure
						  it will work properly, so we would appreciate your help in testing it where
						  feasible.

				  <entry colname="col2"> 
					 <p>Props and eVars are subject to Uniques Exceeded limitations.
						Using this new beta functionality you can bring in attribute data for an
