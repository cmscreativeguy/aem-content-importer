	 <p> A Group is a container for users. You add users to the group, then
		enable access to a solution at the group level. For example, you can create a
		group that has 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> rights, and add users to the group. Contact
		Customer Care if you are an administrator but do not see the 
		<wintitle>Tools</wintitle> link.

		<p>March release for group mapping. UI changing for groups. See 1:Many
		  Mapping PDF in follow-up email list. Vineet 12/15. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>What is it</b> Changing the MC architecture to allow multiple
		  product contexts to map to a single IMS organization. This means that a
		  customer organization can share to MAC with only one Target client, one
		  Analytics login company, etc. Enables multiple product contexts of the same
		  instances (more than one Analytics) Also known as "one to many" mapping. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Customer Value</b> This mapping will allow a simplified org
		  structure for customers with multiple products and multiple organizations.
		  Additionally, the current 1:1 mapping rules are difficult to explain and hard
		  to justify to customers, hindering Marketing Cloud adoption. The 1:many mapping
		  provides a better and more flexible user experience. As customers are
		  implementing the visitor ID service, they need to specify the IMS org ID, right
		  now they need to choose which IMS org ID they need to use, even though data is
		  being collected in various report suites across various log in companies. The
		  one to many mapping will allow customers to effectively implement visitor ID
		  service 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Adobe Value</b> Facilitates complete migration of customers to the
		  Marketing Cloud. Simplifies implementation of multi-org multi-solution
		  customers. Enables Visitor ID service.
