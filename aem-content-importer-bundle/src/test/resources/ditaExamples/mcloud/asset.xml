	 marketing-ready assets that you can share across solutions. An asset is a
	 digital document, image, video, or audio (or part thereof) that can have
	 multiple renditions and can have sub-assets (for example, layers in a Photoshop
	 file, slides in a PowerPoint file, pages in a PDF, files in a ZIP).
