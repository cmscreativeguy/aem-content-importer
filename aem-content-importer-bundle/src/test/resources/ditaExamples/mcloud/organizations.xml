	 <p><b>What Is an Organization?</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>A 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword> organization is the entity that
		enables an administrator to configure groups and users, and to control single
		sign-on in the 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword>. The organization functions like a
		log-in company that spans all the 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword> products and solutions. Most often, an
		organization is your company name. However, a company can have many
		organizations. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Organizations are displayed as tabs on the 
		<wintitle>Manage Organizations</wintitle> page, but you can also identify
		the organization in the domain name, and set the organization as the 
		<xref href="t_add_organization.xml#task_E77B5310EEEC4668830AE501937A2EAD"
		 format="dita" scope="local">default landing</xref>.
	 </p>
	 <p>Each Organization has a unique 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword> ID. Organizations are displayed as
		tabs on the 
		<wintitle>Organizations &amp; Products Access</wintitle> page only after
		Adobe has
