		<term>gender</term>) that you map to the attribute strings and integers.
		These metrics appear in Visitor Profile &gt; Customer Attributes reports.

	 <p><b>Example - Age Metrics</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If you specify a string as 
		<term>age</term>, the system creates the following metrics and
		dimensions: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_440E42AA177241589E5F7E259ED61CE7"> 
		<li id="li_7094C18BFD1C4A0EA51D8B3FD43A707E">Age dimension: Lets you run
		  a report based on the Age attribute. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_F30148DF24FE4D2A94DF51E9DB86F53E">Age metric: A metric you can
		  add to a report, such as a Unique Visitors report. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_DD9A5AEAB01A4C61B402F2998033D54E">Count of Age metric: Lets
		  you understand, for example, if visitors specified an 
		  <term>age</term> value on a form. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>Because metrics are sums in a report table, you should create a
		calculated metric that tells you the average age. The formula for this metric
		is 
		<codeph>Age / Count of Age</codeph>, as shown below: 
	 </p> 
	 <p><image href="graphics/count_of_age_metric.png"
		id="image_F3BDBD5416814AC9AE73102218DBED7F"><?xm-replace_text Paragraph?></image>
		
	 </p> 
	 <p>Metric: Age. You have to make a calculated metric, because metrics are
		sums. Age divided by Count of Age. Age is created as a dimension and a metric
		(for data types Interger and Number in the validate schema). You'll only ever
		see an average age. Using Age as a dimension displays Age as the basis of the
		report (Customer Attributes &gt; Age.) "Count of Age" for example would tell
		you if visitors specified an age value on a form.

	 <p>Add attribute limit (?) to docs, if it isn't there.
