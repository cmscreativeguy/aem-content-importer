  <title>Weekly Unique Visitors</title>
  <shortdesc>A unique visitor refers to an individual who has visited a site
	 the first time within a certain time period. For example, the unique visitor
	 could have visited a site 10 times in a week, but if the time period specifies
	 unique visitors for that week, a single unique visitor will only be counted
	 once for that week. Once that week is over, that unique visitor can be counted
	 again for a new specified time period.
