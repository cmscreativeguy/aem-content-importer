		device. Mobile reports improve visitor identification by collecting data about
		mobile devices used to view your site. Mobile reports can identify a device's
		manufacturer and capabilities, such as screen sizes, video, audio, and cookie
		support, and other metrics. Mobile reports are available for all report suites.
