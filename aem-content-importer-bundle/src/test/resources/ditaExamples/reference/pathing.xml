  <title>Pathing Reports</title>
  <shortdesc> A group of reports based on path analysis. Technically, 
	 <i>pathing</i> means to move from one page name to another (from one value
	 to another).

  <conbody>
    <p>If you need to know the order in which values are collected, then you
		need to enable pathing for the variable collecting those values. Pathing is
		enabled by default for pages. Pathing is not enabled for any props by default,
		because it is only appropriate in certain cases. Contact Customer Care to
		enable pathing on a prop. 
	 </p>
    <note>In Ad Hoc Analysis, when you enable classifications on a prop,
		pathing metrics become available for all the classifications set up for the
		enabled prop.

    <p>
      <b>Example - Pathing on Site Sections</b>
    </p>
    <p>Enabling pathing for the 
		<varname>s.channel</varname> variable allows you to track how site
		visitors move between Site Sections (as the value changes).

    </p>
    <p>Pathing is then available in various paths reports, such as 
		<wintitle>Next Site Section Flow</wintitle>, which displays how visitors
		move through page groups, or sections of your site.

      <b>Example - Pathing on Searches</b>
    </p>
    <p>This same concept of going from one value to another value applies to
		other traffic variables as well, including 
		<varname>s.props</varname>. For example, if you enable pathing for your
		Internal Search Term 
		<varname>s.prop</varname>, you could see the path visitors take through
		search terms. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Example - Pathing per Login Status</b>
    </p>
    <p>You might want to know how people path through your site based on a
		visitor's log-in status. To see this information you would not look at the
		pathing reports for login status, because they would show you how visitors
		changed values in that report, or how visitors might have changed from
		logged-in to logged-out. Instead, concatenate the segment value with the 
		<varname>s.pageName</varname> variable, and then path that resultant
		variable. Here is sample code for page pathing per member status: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.pageName=“Home Page”;
s.prop18=“Gold”; // Member Status
s.prop19=s.prop18 + “:” + s.pageName;</codeblock>
    <p>Then, enable pathing for 
		<varname>s.prop19</varname> to see how members path through pages. 
	 </p>
    <note>If you perform ad hoc analysis, you can segment page paths without
		the need to concatenate segment values, and apply any segment to pathing
		reports.
