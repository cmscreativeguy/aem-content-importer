  <title>Administration API</title>
  <shortdesc>Adobe's Administration API lets you change report suite and user
	 settings without the need to use Admin Tools. This feature is useful if you
	 have a custom reporting interface, letting you make changes to the report suite
	 without having to log in to the interface. There are no limitations to using
	 this API, as compared to Admin Tools. Meaning, if a certain action can be done
	 within Admin Tools, that same action can be done using the Administration API.
