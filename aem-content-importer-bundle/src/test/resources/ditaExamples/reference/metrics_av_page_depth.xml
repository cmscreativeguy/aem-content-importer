  <title>Average Page Depth </title> 
  <shortdesc> Displays on average how far within a visit each value was fired.
	 This metric is valuable in determining how far within a visit your audience
	 reaches a given page or prop value. 
	 <wintitle>Average Page Depth</wintitle> is available on any variable with 
	 <wintitle>pathing</wintitle> enabled.

  <conbody> 
	 <p>For example, if a visit contains the following path: Page A &gt; Page B
		&gt; Page C &gt; Page D &gt; Page E &gt; Page F, the depth is an index of where
		the page is. For example, "Page A" has a depth of 0, while "Page F." has a
		depth of five. The average is based on a combination of all visits. A page
		depth with a value of less than one (such as 0.9) is the mean value of all
		pages visited prior to the page in question. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<wintitle>Page Depth</wintitle> helps you understand where a given page
		typically falls in a user path, regardless of previous or next pages in this
		path. As such, it helps to provide insight into how the page fits into the
		overall picture of the user's experience on your site. This insight can be best
		seen on a 
		<wintitle>Pages</wintitle> report.

					 by default in Ad hoc analysis, and is always on in Marketing Reports and
					 Analytics). In this visit, page A receives the click number of 0. For page B,
					 the click numbers would be 1, 2, and 5. The calculation for the average would

					 receives 1 and 4. The second will not be counted. The calculation would be
