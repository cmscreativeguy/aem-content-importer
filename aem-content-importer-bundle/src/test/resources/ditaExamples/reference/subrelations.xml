  <conbody>
    <p>Functionally, subrelations are also similar to traffic report
		breakdowns, called 
		<term>correlations</term>. Both breakdown types are accessed the same
		way: by clicking on the green magnifying glass to the left of the line item in
		the report table.

    <p> eVars can have three different settings relating to subrelations:

      <li id="li_9B0E32FE75CD4164BAF1AB6EAFC05D80">
        <b>No Subrelations</b>: The
		  variable cannot be broken down by any other variable. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_220A3830F17A45B48953D23FAB89FB8F">
        <b>Basic Subrelations</b>:
		  The variable can be broken down by Tracking codes and several other conversion
		  variables, but no other custom conversion variables. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_63E1AE6DA5E548F5B1751B1D2BF94FD2">
        <b>Full Subrelations</b>:
		  The variable can be broken down by all conversion variables, including custom
		  conversion. 
		  Version 15 and 
		  ad hoc analysis have full subrelations enabled by default.
