          <uicontrol>File Downloads</uicontrol>: Displays the files that have
			 been downloaded from your website. These files can be any type of file you want
			 to track, including user manuals, presentations, audio, or video files. This
			 report requires that link tracking code is installed on the site that you are
			 tracking. See the Implementation Guide for more information.

          <uicontrol>Custom Links</uicontrol>: Shows you the links your site
			 visitors prefer, helping you understand the navigation patterns within your
			 site. For example, the Home page for your site likely has multiple links that
			 access the same page. Perhaps there is graphic and text link that both link to
			 the same page. This report shows what percentage of visitors use the graphic
			 link versus the text link. Custom links are specific to your website. The
			 specific links that you want to track must be modified with special tags. For
			 assistance, contact Customer Care.
