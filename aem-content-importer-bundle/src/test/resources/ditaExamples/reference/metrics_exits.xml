	 a visit.

	 <p>Exit pages have a visit breakdown scope, meaning they persist across all
		hits for a visit. See 
		<xref
		 href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/?f=c_Breakdown_and_segmentation_containers"
		 format="http" scope="external">Breakdown and segmentation containers</xref> for
		more information.
	 </p> 
	 <p>When applied to a dimension, Exits are counted on the last value of a
		visit, which may happen on any hit during the visit. If there is no value on
		the last hit, the Exit is attributed to the most recent value.
	 </p>
	 <p>If an exit occurs outside the reporting range for a visit inside the
		reporting range, it will be included as long as it is not along a month
		boundary (inside the dataset).
