  <title>Breakdown Reports</title> 
  <shortdesc> When a certain segment on which you are reporting is important,
	 you might want to know more about it and how it relates to other reports. This
	 is often called 
	 <term>breaking down</term> a report by another report. A breakdown is the
	 action of integrating two or more correlated items (traffic reports) or two
	 sub-related items (conversion reports).

	 <p>Two types of breakdowns exist: 
		<i>correlation</i> and 
		<i>subrelation</i>.

		  <p><b>Correlation (traffic)</b>: Correlations are enabled on all
			 traffic reports, which enables you to break down any traffic variable by any
			 other in traffic reports. 
		  </p> 
		  <p>An example of a correlation report is a breakdown of a custom
			 traffic report called Age Group, in which you have gathered site visitors’ ages
			 from a survey. This report allows you to see which age group is responsible for
			 the most traffic on your site. However, if you have gone to the trouble of
			 capturing something like the age of a visitor, you might want to know about
			 more than just page views. You can generate a breakdown report about which
			 search engine they use, what keywords they use, or where they are located
			 geographically. You are correlating the age group and the search engine. 
		  </p> 
		  <p>If you break down a correlation report by 
			 <term>Referrer Type</term>, you might see a data point for 
			 <term>Inside Your Site</term>. This value indicates a referrer page
			 that is on the

			 list.

		<li id="li_88E8150D78BC44F28F3C2596533A6BEC"> 
		  <p><b>Subrelation (conversion)</b>: These act the same as correlations,
			 allowing you to relate one report to another. However, they are set up a
			 differently on the back end. Instead of choosing two or more reports to hook
			 together, sub-relations are set up for a single report, which then can either
			 be broken down by everything or only by a few reports. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>By default, there are no correlations when you first implement
		Analytics. However, there are two sets of reports and an additional report that
		are set up with sub-relations enabled. You can break down these sub-relation
		reports by every conversion report, because conversion reports have the
		conversion metrics in them, such as registrations, form completions, sign-ups,
		orders, revenue, and so on. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Traffic and Conversion Breakdown Differences</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>You can break down a traffic report into another traffic report. You can
		break down a conversion report into another conversion report. However, traffic
		report cannot be broken down by a conversion report. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Traffic report breakdowns are multi-level. Meaning, you can break down
		up to 20 reports by each other. The only applicable metric for traffic
		breakdowns is Page View. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Conversion report breakdowns are single-level. Meaning, you can break
		down only one conversion report by another. All conversion metrics are
		applicable to this type of breakdown report.
