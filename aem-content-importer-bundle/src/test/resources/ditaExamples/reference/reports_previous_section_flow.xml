  <title>Previous Section Flow Report</title>
  <shortdesc>The Previous Section Flow report is similar to the Previous Page
	 Flow report. It displays data for Site Sections (groups of related web pages).
	 If a page is contained in more than one site section, then the report displays
	 data for all site sections.

    <p> For example, an online retailer might have site sections for its
		products and site sections for product brands. In this case, a product web page
		can fall under multiple sight sections. Though a product page has only been
		viewed once, the Previous Section Flow report shows a page view for each sight
		section associated with the page.
