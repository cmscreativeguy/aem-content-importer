  <title>Next Page Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Provides detailed site path analysis by showing you the pages that
	 visitors viewed after seeing a selected page on your site. For example, when
	 selecting and reporting on your entire site, the report shows the top ten
	 landing pages, with the five most popular next pages listed under each landing
	 page. This data can help you understand which content and features most often
	 compel your visitors to move through your site.
