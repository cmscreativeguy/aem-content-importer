	 include the 4-4-5 and 4-5-4 calendar models, both of which are used as
	 standards for the retail industry. Additionally, reporting offers an option for

    <note type="warning">Changing the calendar changes the way data is
		processed (i.e. the definition of weekly and monthly unique visitors). When a
		calendar's definition of weeks and months changes, historical data is not
		altered. 
	 </note>
    <p>You can use the calendar to define the first day of the week and year,
		or use a different retail calendar style. The calendar formats are used to for
		various purposes, including sales comparison and forecast standardization,
		payroll cost analysis, or physical inventory count regulation. For example, the
		retail industry uses the 4-5-4 accounting calendar to support selling season's
		particular to the retail industry. Each of the calendar formats is described
		below.

      <title>Items Affected by Changing Calendar Formats</title>
      <p>Because the definition of a week/month/year is changed, the following
		  will also be changed accordingly: 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_D30E52C63F2B401DB1E2503CE08CB357">
        <li id="li_8DEEE7399CBD4F6E9ECD3A75914CC95F">
          <b>Unique Visitors</b>:
			 Because unique visitors are based on calendar formats, changing this affects
			 the accuracy of 
			 version 14 
			 <wintitle>Unique Visitor</wintitle> reports. It is strongly
			 recommended to change the calendar at the end of a specific reporting period
			 (such as the end of a month, quarter, or year) to help mitigate this. 
			 Visitor reports are not affected. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_96EACD30465743CBB56952B66D2370AC">
          <b>Scheduled Reports</b>:
			 Scheduled reports go out based on the Gregorian calendar, which can potentially
			 affect when you wish to scheduled reports sent when using a different calendar.
			 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_294F71C651D04A4FB73B1AD714B3A015">
          <b>Dashboards and Bookmark date ranges</b>: Rolling date ranges can
			 only be set to Daily, meaning that every day the date range rolls forward a
			 single day without regard to preset. 
		  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The calendar tool remains a standard Gregorian Calendar
		  even after changing to another calendar format. Because of this, the following
		  features are affected: 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_B79885392E9F45069AD19768FAA56A82">
        <li id="li_2C19CAB607E3452CA7CCDA9FEA4A367B">Selecting an individual
			 day functions normally. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_7E6D47A53DAC440D8BFB6C2034B145C7">Selecting a full week work
			 only if a week is defined as Sunday through Saturday. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_ECB1D4622C12466581BE75CC6E9BE647">Selecting a month works
			 only if a month is defined as all 30/31 days. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_697E2AABFB1645998ABB34066546B76D">
          <b>Forecasting</b>: When viewing certain trended reports (such as the
			 Page Views report), daily forecasts are displayed that attempt to predict the
			 amount of page views for the rest of the current day/week/month. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_B47D3CB7E1194D86844790D188DCFD0C">
          <b> Previous range trend
				lines</b>: When viewing certain trended reports, orange and green trend lines
			 are shown, which display certain previous date ranges. For example, selecting
			 all of September displays that month's data, as well as 4 weeks and 52 weeks
			 prior.
