  <title>Original Referring Domains Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Displays the original referrers that produced the customers on
	 your site. Because customers can visit your site multiple times and have a
	 different referrer for each visit, this report shows how they were referred the
	 first time they arrived at your site. This report references referrers only by
	 their base domain (<filepath>aol.com</filepath>, 
	 <filepath>yahoo.com</filepath>, and so on).

    <p>You can view the number of visitors generated by an original referrer or
		discover how much revenue each original referrer was responsible for producing.
		Referrer reports can be populated each time a visitor comes to your site, even
		if the visitor comes to the site multiple times during a session (before the
		visit expires.)
