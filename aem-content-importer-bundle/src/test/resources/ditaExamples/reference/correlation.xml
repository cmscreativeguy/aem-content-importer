  <title>Correlation</title>
  <shortdesc> The relationship between two Traffic reports in a report suite.
	 You can run correlation reports by breaking down report data. For example, you
	 can run a correlation breakdown report that shows visitor age group correlated
	 with the type of search engine the visitors use.

    <p>Correlations are particularly useful for understanding the relationships
		between two or more Traffic Custom Insight variables, or other system
		variables. Correlations come in three sizes (2, 5, and 20), based on the number
		of items that are correlated together at the same time.
