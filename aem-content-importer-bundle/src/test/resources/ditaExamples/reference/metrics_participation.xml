  <shortdesc>Participation metrics assign full credit from success events to
	 all values of an eVar that were passed during a visit. Participation metrics
	 are useful to determine which pages, campaigns, or other custom variable values
	 are contributing most to the success of your site. Participation is visit
	 based. All eVar values in a visit prior to and including the hit when an event
	 occurs receive participation credit regardless of the expiration setting.

	 <p>Participation metrics have three settings per conversion event: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_7D887E6CAC1344D184705005FCDC6765"> 
		<li id="li_5CCCA013E0DA4930AE3E12BBA08FB70B"> 
		  <b>Disabled</b>: The default state of each conversion event.
		  Participation data will not be gathered for this event. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_9B2D3E4C97EC4C0F95506975234F9997"> 
		  <b>Enabled</b>: Participation data is collected for this event.
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p>Once enabled, participation metrics are automatically available in all
		conversion reports. However, participation metrics also can be viewed in
		specific traffic reports at your request. You can optionally request
		participation metrics be available in certain custom traffic reports.

		<title>Revenue Participation Example</title> 
		<p>Assume the following sequence: 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		<ol id="ol_0A0C929004D444F482BA0BCFE1D08ACA"> 
		  <li id="li_93F5DF08F1E549FFA721E4162238473F">A user navigates to your
			 site and searches for "shoes".
		  </li>
		  <li id="li_FB519F5CEF464092A915E906BEC10DBA">The user then searches for
			 "tennis shoes".
		  </li>
		  <li id="li_4592AA6E7D6046BD869474192EAC8C18">The user clicks a links to
			 the product page, adds the item to the cart, and makes a $120 purchase.
		  </li> 
		</ol> 
		</p> 
		<p>When displaying Revenue in the Internal Search Terms Report, you would
		  see the following based on the selected allocation: 
		</p> 
		<ul id="ul_E745E6150EF043DDA0AB0E6512E16DC2"> 
		  <li id="li_720EBC8EA3FF4DCCB0FA47578CFF1DA5"> 
			 <b>First</b>: "shoes" would get credit for the $120. "tennis shoes"
			 would get $0. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_C2BE8CFDA642426F9E3418B10C667764"> 
			 <b>Last</b>: "tennis shoes" would get credit for the $120. "shoes"
			 would get $0. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_F0045AFA21074CA5818DC58FA28FB501"> 
			 <p><b>Linear</b>: Each campaign would get $60 credit.
			 </p>
			 <p>Participation is similar to linear allocation, except full credit
				is given to all values. If you use Revenue (Participation) as the metric,
				allocation is disregarded. Revenue (Participation) in this example would report
				$120 for both search terms.
			 </p>
		  </li> 
		</ul>
