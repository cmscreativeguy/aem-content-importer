	 <p> Version 14 calculates the average time spent on a page by placing each
		sequence of a specific variable value into one of ten ranges or buckets that
		represent average periods of time. For example, if a visitor spends 00:01:15 on
		a web page, the reported Time Spent on Page metric is 00:02:00. (The midpoint
		value of the 1 to 3 minute range). 
	 </p> 
	 <p> Version 15 and ad hoc analysis use explicit values (including link
		events and video views) to calculate Time Spent, so the reported Time Spent on
		Page value in this example would be 00:01:15.
