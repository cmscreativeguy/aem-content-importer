  <title>Report Suite</title>
  <shortdesc>A report suite defines the complete, independent reporting on a
	 chosen website, set of websites, or subset of web pages. Usually, a report
	 suite is one website, but it can be a global segment where you have combined
	 several sites' numbers to get totals. When you log in to the marketing reports,
	 ad hoc analysis, and report builder, you select one report suite to use (except
	 when you use roll-ups that combine report suites).

		stores.
