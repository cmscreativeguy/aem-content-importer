  <title>File Downloads Report</title>
  <shortdesc>The 
	 <wintitle>File Downloads Report</wintitle> helps you understand how often
	 your visitors download files from your site. Examples of file downloads may be
	 word processor documents, spreadsheets, audio files, movie files, user manuals,
	 and so on. This includes both files being saved and opened directly from the
	 browser, as well as files saved to the user's computer. The report shows the
	 name of the file being downloaded, including the complete URL required to
	 access the file.

      <li id="li_5E5157A5E3D94C9A99B809D23E42C672">Determine the files that are
		  downloaded most frequently from your site.

      <li id="li_70DA8E0D189B480C87AAABE8D3273D26">Understand if certain files

		  <p>For example, perhaps you are currently translating your user manuals
			 into twelve languages and making them available via your Web site. With file
			 download reporting, you can know how often each user manual version is
			 downloaded and can assess the value of continuing to translate the user manual
			 into all twelve languages.

      <b>Troubleshooting</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Marketing reports capture information on files downloaded
		from any page of your site that contains 
		JavaScript code. However, certain
		variables must be present and set correctly so that file download information
		can be reported. If this report is not displaying data, or does not show the
		expected values, follow the steps below to validate your implementation.
	 </p>
    <ol id="ol_7146C95F405C46EF9D026534FEE3A54A">
      <li id="li_FC00BDE5585D474E8928112E3AFE9486">On your site, locate the
		  global 
		  JavaScript file. This is frequently
		  named 
		  <filepath>s_code.js</filepath>, but may have been renamed. If it has
		  been renamed, you can search the JavaScript files on your site for the value 
		  <varname>s_account</varname>, which is a part of the 
		  JavaScript code.
		</li>
      <li id="li_3958100E1B984911BAF44F3221ED44A5">In the file, locate the 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/index.html?f=c_trackdownllinks" format="http" scope="external">s.trackDownloadLinks</xref> variable. Ensure
		  that it is set to 
		  <i>true</i></li>
      <li id="li_FBD77749BFA248129849AABAA21FCD57">Locate the 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/index.html?f=c_linkdownfiletypes" format="http" scope="external">s.linkDownloadFileTypes</xref> variable. Ensure
		  that all of the desired file extensions are present in this list. If necessary,
		  add missing extensions like 
		  <filepath>.zip</filepath>, 
		  <filepath>.pdf</filepath>, and so on.)
		</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If these variables appear to be configured correctly, but the 
		<wintitle>File Downloads Report</wintitle> still is not receiving data,
		your organization's supported users should contact Customer Care.
