  <title>Login Company</title>
  <shortdesc>A login company is a collection of report suites used by your
	 organization. Some organizations have multiple login companies that apply to
	 different parts of the organization. This is especially useful for large
	 organizations that deal with different business units where many report suites
	 are not applicable to others in the company.
