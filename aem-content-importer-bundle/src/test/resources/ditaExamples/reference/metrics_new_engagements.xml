  <title>New Engagements</title>
  <shortdesc>New Engagements is a Marketing Channel reporting metric that
	 counts new visitors that come as a result of a channel. This metric also counts
	 visitors who have not been to your site in the last 30 days. A New Engagement
	 is an eVar set at the beginning of each visit (original allocation).
	 First-touch channels can also be New Engagements, depending on visitor
	 engagement expiration setting.
