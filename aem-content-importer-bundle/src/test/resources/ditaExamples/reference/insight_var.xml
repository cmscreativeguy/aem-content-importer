  <title>Conversion Variable (eVar)</title> 
  <shortdesc> The Custom Insight Conversion Variable (eVar) is placed in the
	 Adobe code on selected web pages of your site. Its primary purpose is to
	 segment conversion success metrics in custom marketing reports. eVar variables
	 can be visit-based and can function similarly to cookies on the site. Values
	 passed into eVar variables follow the user for a predetermined period of time,
	 based on configurations made on the 
	 <wintitle>Settings</wintitle> tab.
