    <p>If you have several web entities, a Global Report Suite can give you
		global totals for Traffic and Conversion Metrics and event Paths. To capture
		multiple Report Suites, set the multiple IDs into the 
		<varname>s_account</varname> variable delimited by commas.
	 </p>
    <p>When you use multi-suite tagging or roll-up functionality to create a
		global report suite, you need to create a page naming strategy that works
		within a global report suite. Within a multi-suite environment, Adobe
		recommends that you add a brand and/or region identifier to each page name.
		This identifier will be most important in the global report suite because
		without it you cannot discern which pages belong to which web sites. To keep
		page names concise, consider using recognizable acronyms for each regional or
		brand-specific site:
