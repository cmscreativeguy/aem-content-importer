  <title>Character Sets</title>
  <shortdesc>Refers to the set of characters found in each language. Each
	 language is either single-byte or a multi-byte character set. Multi-byte
	 character sets are comprised of characters that require more than one byte per
	 character. Single-byte character sets are comprised of characters that require
	 a single byte per character. Latin-based languages are single-byte, whereas
	 non-Latin languages like Japanese are multi-byte.
