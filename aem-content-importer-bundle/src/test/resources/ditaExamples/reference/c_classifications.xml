  <title>About Classifications</title>
  <shortdesc>A 
	 <term>classification</term> is a way of categorizing reporting and
	 analytics variable data, then displaying the data in different ways when you
	 generate reports.

    <p> When classifying, you are establishing a relationship between the
		variable and the metadata related to that variable. Classifications are most
		frequently used in campaigns. Data collected using variables (eVars, props, and
		events) information can be rolled up by applying metadata to the values
		collected in the variables.

    </p>
    <p>Once classified, any report that you can generate using the key variable
		can also be generated using the associated attributes. For example, you can
		classify 
		<wintitle>Product IDs</wintitle> with additional product attributes, such
		as product name, color, size, description, and SKU. Augmenting reporting and
		analytics data with additional attributes provides deeper and more complex
		reporting opportunities. 
	 </p>
    <p>After creating the classifications, you can leverage the new data
		attributes throughout Marketing Cloud reporting and analytics 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tracking Codes Example</b>
    </p>
    <p>Suppose that instead of viewing campaigns just by the tracking code, you
		want to see campaign results by Search Engine, Keyword, and Campaign Channel.
		Rather than devoting conversion variables for each of those, you can create
		three classifications of the campaign variable to represent Search Engine,
		Keyword, and Campaign Channel. This strategy allows you to see site success
		events by all four variables, with no additional tagging. 
	 </p>
    <p>Reporting and analytics includes pre-defined classifications for the
		tracking code variable, which offers classification-based reports called
		Creative Elements and Campaigns. You must manually configure classifications
		for all other conversion and traffic variables.

              <p>Text classifications define a category that lets you group
					 variable data for reporting purposes.

              <p>For example, if you sell shirts, you might want to categorize
					 shirt sales (conversions) by color, size, and style so you can generate reports
					 that let you see shirt sales organized by these categories.

              <p>A date-enabled text classification lets you assign date ranges

					 <wintitle>Campaigns</wintitle> report.

              <p>You can include the actual campaign dates in the data file
