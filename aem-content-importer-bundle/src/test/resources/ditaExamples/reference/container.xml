  <title>Segment Container</title>
  <shortdesc>The Segment Builder utilizes a container architecture that lets
	 you determine what to include in a segment. The Visitor container is the
	 outermost container and includes overarching data specific to the visitor
	 across visits and page views. A nested Visit container lets you set rules to
	 break down the visitor's data based on visits, and a nested Hit container lets
	 you break down visitor information based on individual page views. Each
	 container lets you report across a visitor's history, interactions broken down
	 by visits, or break down individual hits.
