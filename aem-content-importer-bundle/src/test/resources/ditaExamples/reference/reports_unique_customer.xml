  <title>Unique Customers Report</title>
  <shortdesc>A Unique Visitor who makes a purchase. A Unique Customer is
	 counted once for that time frame but cannot be counted again, no matter how
	 many times the visitor returns to make a purchase. A Unique Visitor is counted
	 once for the first visit in a specified period and not counted again until the
	 period expires. After the period expires, the Unique Visitor is counted again.
	 Unique Customers are always counted as Unique Visitors because they must visit
	 the site in order to make the purchase.
