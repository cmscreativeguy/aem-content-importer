		a set of rules (or filters) identifying visitors who satisfy specific rules
		based on a positive case. A decision tree sets rules to classify visitors who
		satisfy (or do not satisfy) this positive case. These rules generate a tree map
		to provide a level of confidence to meet these positive case results.
