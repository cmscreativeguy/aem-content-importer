  <title>Next Section Flow Report</title>
  <shortdesc> The Next Section Flow report is similar to the Next Page Flow
	 report. It displays data for Site Sections (groups of related web pages). If a
	 page is contained in more than one site section, the report displays data for
	 all site sections.

    <p> For example, an online retailer might have site sections for its
		products and site sections for product brands. In this case, a product web page
		can fall under multiple sight sections. Though a product page has only been
		viewed once, the Next Section Flow report shows a page view for each sight
		section associated with the page.
