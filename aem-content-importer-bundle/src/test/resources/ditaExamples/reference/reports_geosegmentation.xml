				  <p>Adobe has partnered with Digital Envoy, a leading provider of
					 IP intelligence and authentication solutions, to offer GeoSegmentation, a
					 geographical measurement capability based on end users' IP addresses. While
					 accuracy based on individual data sets may vary, generally Digital Envoy offers
					 over 99% accuracy at the country level, over 97% accuracy at the region level,
					 and over 90% accuracy at the city level.

					 <li id="li_C3A21E7C1186490EB9A236634DB45E7F">IP addresses that
						represent corporate proxies. These can appear as traffic coming through the
						user's corporate network, which may actually be a different location if the
						user is working remotely. 
					 </li> 
					 <li id="li_56FC36B3598C420F9246D4E8772822A7">Mobile IP
						addresses. Mobile IP targeting works at varying levels depending on the
						location and the network. A number of carriers backhaul IP traffic through
						centralized or regional POPs.

					 <li id="li_C1EED854AE584489BCBC2A7AA20B8EF1">IP addresses
						belonging to users of satellite ISPs. Identifying the specific location of
						these users is difficult, as they usually appear to come from the location of
						the uplink.

					 <li id="li_A735756F39554DF19E05D251CA614F02">Military and
						government IPs. This often represents personnel traveling around the globe and
						entering through their home location, rather than the base or office where they
