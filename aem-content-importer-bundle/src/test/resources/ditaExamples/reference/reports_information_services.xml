  <title>Information Services Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Groups mobile devices based on the news services (Channel I/B, EZ
	 News Flash, W+INFO, and so on.) that they support. When a visitor uses a mobile
	 device with news service support to access your site, the Information Services
	 report increments by at least one. If the phone supports multiple news
	 services, each of those groups in the report increments. Because of this, the
	 sum of the groups might be greater than the total shown at the bottom of the
	 report.
