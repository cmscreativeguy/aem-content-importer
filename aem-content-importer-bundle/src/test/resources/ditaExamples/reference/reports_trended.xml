    <p> In the graph, the vertical axis displays the tracked items. The
		horizontal axis displays the time granularity. In the table, you can trend from
		a specific cell, and launch a full report from the cell. The date or time used
		is based the cell's value. 
	 </p>
    <p>You can also select multiple cells and launch a trended report, based on
		a selected granularity. When you trend from multiple cells, the report columns
		display data for the entire reporting period. 
	 </p>
    <p>A 
		<wintitle>Products Report</wintitle> is an example of a trended report.
		You can see how much revenue a product made during the selected period. If your
		reporting period is a week, you can see how much revenue that product generated
		for each day of the time period, you can show a trend graph for a specific
		product on that day, or open a separate trended report for the selection.
