		<title>Understanding Data Batching</title> 
		<p>To understand if data is latent, it is important to understand how
		  Analytics processes data. 
		</p> 
		<p>Each data collection server captures and processes raw analytics data,
		  and then uploads batched data on an hourly basis for reporting. The transfer
		  process typically takes 30 minutes, so normal latency for traffic that occurs
		  directly after the previous upload process completes is around 90 minutes (60
		  minutes until the next batch upload occurs, then 30 minutes for file transfer
		  and display). For traffic that occurs directly before an upload, data latency
		  could drop to 30 minutes (0 minutes until the next batch upload occurs, then 30
		  minutes for file transfer and display).

		  data uploads (instead of hourly) for your top report suites. 
		</p> 
		<p>You can typically expect to see complete data in reports 2 hours after
		  the data is collected.

		<title>What Contributes to Latency?</title> 
		<p>Latency does not affect data collection, and its severity (how current
		  the data is) and length (the time it takes to resolve) can vary greatly.
		  However, it is usually limited to a single report suite. 
		</p> 
		<p>Latency is caused by one of following general categories: 
		</p> 
		<ul id="ul_6E5CDC94A5B94159AEBBD4CC1FA287DB"> 
		  <li id="li_022559BB0AAC41CC820644318803198E">Unexpected traffic spike:
			 This occurs when more data is sent to a report suite than was contractually
			 committed or expected. It is the most common cause of latency. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_C342593494F64574B05BA5E0517824C9">Normal hardware issues: We
			 employ best-in-class strategies for data center management and monitoring, data
			 redundancy, and hardware reliability. Hardware is updated on a regular basis
			 and in conjunction with published maintenance windows. Emergency maintenance of
			 failing hardware may require a necessary and temporary halt in data processing
			 (not in data collection) as replacement hardware is brought online. This
			 temporary halt in processing can result in noticeable latency. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_0ACCBEB88E59418687F89B8D1E92C5B3">Abnormal data: Unnatural
			 data patterns, such as unusually long visits caused by a bot or spider, can
			 temporarily increase certain processing loads that result in latency.

		<title>Ways to Mitigate or Prevent Latency</title>

		  when it occurs:

		  <li id="li_FC638ED18BFD48449F15A78EF67839F5">Notify Adobe of expected
			 traffic spikes: While it is impossible to anticipate every traffic spike to
			 your site, there may be cases where you are expecting to receive a significant
			 increase in traffic (such as during a particularly successful holiday period or
			 shortly after a large campaign push). In these cases, Adobe provides a way for
			 your organization to inform us of expected traffic increases so that we can
			 allocate additional processing resources to your report suite.
