    <p>You can use the Segment Definition Builder to create new segment filters
		or to edit an existing filter. When submitting a data warehouse request, you
		can apply a segment filter to the result set to analyze your website traffic.
		Segments created in data warehouse are also available in the ASI feature. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, the segment of visitors that purchased $300 during a sales
		promotion held during the past eight days is a segment filter.
