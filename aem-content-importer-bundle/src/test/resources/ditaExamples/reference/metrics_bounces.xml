  <title>Bounces</title> 
  <shortdesc>A visit that consists of a single server call. For example, a
	 single page visit is a bounce if a visitor does not interact with the page in a
	 way that sends data to Adobe, such as clicking a link or a video start. If more
	 than a single hit is received in a visit, a Bounce is not counted.
