  <title>Pathing</title>
  <shortdesc>Pathing is defined as the path that users take through your site.
	 For example, a visitor went to page A, then page B, then page C.

    <p>If you need to know the order in which values are collected, then you
		need to enable pathing for the variable collecting those values. Pathing is
		enabled by default at the page level. Pathing is not enabled for any custom
		traffic variables (props) by default, because it is only appropriate in certain
		cases. Contact Customer Care to enable pathing on a prop.
	 </p>
    <p>Note: In Ad Hoc Analysis, when you enable classifications on a prop,
		pathing metrics become available for all the classifications set up for the
		enabled prop.
