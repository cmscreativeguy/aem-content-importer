  <title>Products Conversion Funnel Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Shows averages for the Product Views, Cart Additions, Orders,
	 Revenue, and Units metrics. It also shows key conversions between important
	 data in each reporting group and standard conversion metrics (Orders, Units,
	 and Revenue). The top (overview) of the funnel provides a visual summary of
	 conversion data. The funnel section shows statistics for all events in the
	 overview section based on Orders and up to two other metrics, such as Revenue
	 and Units.

    <p>Because the current time periods are not yet completed when you view
		data, this report can indicate a downward trend from the previous to the
		current time period. For example, there can be fewer visits today than
		yesterday, but only because the rest of the time period’s statistics have yet
		to occur.
