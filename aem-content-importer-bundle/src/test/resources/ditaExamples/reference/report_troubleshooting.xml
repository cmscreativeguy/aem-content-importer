  <title>Reporting Best Practices and Troubleshooting</title> 
  <shortdesc>Adobe Analytics provides a flexible reporting interface that lets
	 you generate a variety of complex reports. While most reports generate very
	 quickly, you might encounter reports that timeout or fail to generate
	 successfully. To help avoid report generation failures, this section explains
	 many factors that impact report generation speed. Understanding this
	 information can help you structure reports so they are more likely to generate
	 successfully.

		<title>Report Timeouts and Request Queue</title> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Timeouts</b> 
		</p> 
		<p>A single report is broken into multiple requests (one per breakdown),
		  and each request is subject to an individual timeout. Scheduled reports are
		  granted longer timeout periods and are more likely to succeed than reports that
		  are generated directly in a user interface. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Report Suite Queue</b> 
		</p> 
		<p>Each report suite maintains a separate queue of requests. If many
		  reports are requested simultaneously, even from separate users, a small number
		  of reports are generated simultaneously. As reports complete, remaining reports
		  are generated in the order in which they were received. As a result, if a large
		  number of complex reports are already in the report suite queue, a report that
		  typically generates quickly might time out. 
		</p>

	 <section id="section_6BA937EB6CEC4CBCB71FAAD32F031DC2"> 
		<title>Factors that Affect Report Speed</title> 
		<p>The following factors contribute to longer report generation times.
		  Increasing one of these factors might not result in a timeout for that report,
		  but it might delay other reports in the report suite queue and cause a
		  subsequent report to timeout. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Report Time Range</b> 
		</p> 
		<p> The largest factor that affects report generation time is the number
		  of months requested. Reducing the number of months from three to one decreases
		  generation time significantly, but reducing the time range from one month to
		  one week does not have a large impact on report generation time. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Number of metrics</b> 
		</p> 
		<p>As the number of metrics increases, the report run time increases.
		  Removing metrics often improves report generation time. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Number of breakdowns</b> 
		</p> 
		<p>Within a report, each breakdown represents a separate request. While
		  individual requests may complete quickly, running thousands of breakdowns in a
		  single report can significantly slow down report generation time and affect the
		  report suite queue. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Segment complexity</b> 
		</p> 
		<p>Segments that consider many dimensions or have many (24+) rules
		  increase the processing impact and increase the report generation time. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Number of unique values</b> 
		</p> 
		<p>Reports that contain hundreds of thousands of unique values generate
		  more slowly than reports that contain fewer unique values, even if the segment
		  or filter reduces the number of values that ultimately appear in a report. For
		  example, a report that displays search terms typically generates more slowly
		  than other reports, even if a filter is applied to show only search terms that
		  contain a specific value.

		<title>Other Reporting Options</title> 
		<p>In addition to reducing the time range, number of metrics, and number
		  of breakdowns in a report, the following guidelines help increase reliability
		  of report delivery: 
		</p> 
		<ul id="ul_2495E44E498E4C4DB6352BD2CA52CC0A"> 
		  <li id="li_A162879CA0974BF1A28F8F185A81A870">Use data warehouse to
			 request reports that contain many breakdowns or metrics. Data warehouse is
			 designed to generate these types of reports. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_27CD4FFDB5AA48689A4487FD2FC6CEAE">Schedule reports to run
			 during non-peak hours. This increases the likelihood of a report returning
			 because the request queue for a report suite is more likely to be empty during
			 those times. 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_A62F0441585B48F78D896268FB6C45D2">Report builder can be used
			 to break reports into smaller time ranges and requests that contain fewer
			 metrics. You can then use native Excel functionality to merge data from various
			 requests into a single report.
