      <p>Custom reports can bring increased value to you as an analyst. If you
		  see reports in your SiteCatalyst interface that don't match someone else's
		  (such as in Training), your administrator may have set up some of these custom
		  reports. 
		</p>
      <p>Additionally, you can save reports that are important to you. These
		  reports are called bookmarks. You can also put several reports onto one canvas
		  to get a quick look at your most important reports. These are called dashboards
		  and are also user-specific. The interface displays a bar above the graph
		  listing your bookmarks and dashboards.
