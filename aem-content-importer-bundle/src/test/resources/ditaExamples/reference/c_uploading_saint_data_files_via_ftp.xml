    <p>The following recommended limits are important: 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_A004EF4EA7344D7DB0B17E979693689C">
        <li id="li_D8CB70A2E6FF4A99B31A4E51560BE422">If the upload applies to one
		  report suite only, the upload cannot be larger than 30 MB. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_C61A4C2355E34990885E4983613A838B">If the upload applies to
		  fewer than two to four report suites, the initial bulk upload cannot be larger
		  than 15 MB. Subsequent delta (update) files cannot be larger than 3 MB. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_B771B3A208E745C0B02E79371A8C1D16">If the upload applies to
		  five or more report suites, an initial setup file cannot be larger than 5 MB.
		  Subsequent delta files cannot be larger than 2 MB. 
		</li>
        <li id="li_12D25EC9DC0346F49BDE0C601FAA5FCE">The FTP limit is 50 MB.
		  (Meaning, you can upload a 30 MB and 20 MB file at the same time, but you
		  cannot upload two 30 MB files.) 
		</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The initial setup populates the classifications database with a large
		set of original data, or restructures the classifications, rather than
		reclassifying a few rows or adding rows. 
	 </p>
    <p>Following an initial upload in a report suite (for a given variable or
		report), Adobe recommends uploading only new and updated rows in subsequent
		imports. Rows that are not being changed should be omitted from future uploads.
		
	 </p>
    <p> Each new key value you upload counts against your uniques for that
		variable for the month. 
	 </p>
    <p>If you have exceeded your uniques for the month, you will not see the
		corresponding classifications data for the uniques exceeded values in
		reporting. You can see those classifications in either data warehouse or ad hoc
		analysis. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note>The time required to process a classification data file varies on
		  the size of the file and the current number of files already being processed by
		  Adobe’s servers. Processing of data files usually takes no longer than 72
		  hours. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>Before uploading data via FTP, create an FTP account. For more
		information, see
