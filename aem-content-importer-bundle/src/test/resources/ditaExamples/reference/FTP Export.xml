		<li id="li_CAB8AC0D78444BEE83CD0631D275D034">You can use wild cards when
		  defining the data filter. Use an asterisk (*) to match zero or more characters
		  and a question mark (?) to match exactly one character. Use ?* to match one or
		  more characters. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_18E7BC3A9B4E47F38BDB4F17C35DD30D">Typically, when applying
		  both types of data filters to a download, only rows that match both rules are
		  downloaded. However, the following exceptions apply: 
		  <p> 
		  <ul id="ul_F18856C36B964778994857339B063C82"> 
			 <li id="li_483F2D05AE7649FC87D0EBCBF79EABC7">If 
				<wintitle>Rows with empty column = All Columns</wintitle>, then all
				columns except the column specified in the first rule are checked for
				emptiness. This exception ensures that the tool downloads any row with a column
				that matches the first rule that also has all other columns empty. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_07FCE5A080924C0DA48D2518BC480881">When downloading data
				rows based on empty columns, all columns except those specified in the first
				rule are checked for emptiness. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_673AAC78201348BBB04803D75F6C983A">If the same column is
				specified for both filter rules (it is almost impossible to meet both criteria)
				then only rows that match the first rule are downloaded.
