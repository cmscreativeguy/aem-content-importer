  <title>Metric</title>
  <shortdesc>Metrics are quantitative information about visitor activity, such
	 as Views, Click-Throughs, Reloads, Average Time spent, Units, Orders, and
	 Revenue. They are the foundation of reports and help you view and understand
	 data relationships. They let you perform side-by-side comparisons of different
	 data sets about your website.

    <p>Metrics and associated data are displayed in the columns of reports.
		Broad categories of metrics include:
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Traffic metrics</b>: These show data about the volume of visitors.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Conversion metrics</b>: These show data about success events, such as
		purchases, downloads, or any other action that you want users to take on your
		website.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Calculated metrics</b>: These are metrics you create by combining
		metrics. For example, you can create a metric that subtracts the Keyword Cost
		and the Cost of Goods from Revenue. This calculated metric lets you see the net
		revenue. You could then divide this value by Total Orders to see the average
		net revenue per order. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Video metrics</b>: Marketing reports provide support for tracking a
		number of video metrics, including total views, time spent, and completion
		rates.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Social metrics</b>: These help you measure your brand's presence on
		the social web. Social metrics work with Analytics standard metrics. By
		combining these with calculated metrics, you can view a report that shows how
		often a product is mentioned, gauge product sentiment, and see how Social
		metrics correlate with Analytics key performance indicators.
