  <title>Conversion Reports</title>
  <shortdesc>Provide comprehensive, accurate, and detailed analysis of customer
	 activity. Metrics such as campaign management, sales cycle, customer fallout,
	 and customer conversion let you measure e-commerce transactions, sources of
	 sales, advertising effectiveness, customer loyalty, and more.

    <p>For example, if you want to see what type of internal campaigns on your
		home page might result in purchases, you first must capture the internal
		tracking codes and set persistence to a period of one visit for the 
		<varname>s.eVar</varname> that captures internal campaigns. When a
		success event is completed (like purchase), the credit for that success is
		given to any Conversion Variables that are persistent on the visitor, such as
		Internal Campaign ID. By running the 
		<wintitle>Internal Campaign Report</wintitle>, you can see which campaign
		generated the most onsite conversion. 
	 </p>
    <p>Some out-of-the-box reports contain both Traffic and Conversion metrics
		(such as the 
		<wintitle>Search Engine</wintitle> reports). However, 
		<wintitle>Traffic</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Conversion</wintitle> reports are unique to your organization
		and are displayed in the 
		<uicontrol>Traffic</uicontrol> and 
		<uicontrol>Conversion</uicontrol> menus.
