  <title>Next Server Flow Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Displays the navigation data between servers on your site. When
	 you select a server name from your site, the report shows you the number of
	 visitors who navigated from that server to each of the other servers on your
	 site within a single visit or across visits.

    <p> For example, if you have specific data on different servers or have
		mirrored data on separate servers, the report shows you the path between
		servers that the users hit. This is also true of domains within your website.
		For example, you can see how many users went from a 
		<filepath>www.mysite.com</filepath> to 
		<filepath>info.mysite.com</filepath> or 
		<filepath>sales.mysite.com</filepath>.
