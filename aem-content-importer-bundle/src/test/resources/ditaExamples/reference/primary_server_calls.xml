  <title>Server Call</title> 
  <shortdesc>A server call, also known as a "hit" or an "image request", is an
	 instance in which data is sent to Adobe servers to process. The most common
	 type of server call is a page view. A page view is where a visitor views a page
	 on your website and a server call is generated to Adobe, where information is
	 collected, processed, and then included in your report metrics. There are other
	 types of server calls, including exit links and file downloads, where data is
	 sent to Adobe to process, but is not recorded as a new page view. Even
	 "excluded" page views (excluded from your reports by an IP address range you
	 configure, for example) are server calls because they are received and
	 processed by Adobe but never show up in your reports.
