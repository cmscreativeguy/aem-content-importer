  <title>New Marketing Cloud Users</title>
  <shortdesc>When a new Analytics user is created in the Marketing Cloud
	 (marketing.adobe.com), he or she is automatically added to the New Marketing
	 Cloud Users group. The New Marketing Cloud Users group has no privileges. After
	 account creation, you must move users from this group to another Analytics
	 group according to the privilege level you want assigned.

    <p>If a user attempts to launch marketing reports &amp; analytics before he
		or she is added to a different group, an "Access for this account is
		unavailable" error is displayed. 
	 </p>
    <p>To provision these users, see

		After you add these users to a different group, we recommend removing these
		users from the New Marketing Cloud Users groups. This helps you keep track of
		which users have additional group access and which users still need to be
		provisioned.
