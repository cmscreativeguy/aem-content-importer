  <title>Publishing Lists</title>
  <shortdesc>Publishing lists provide an easy way to send various reports
	 specific to different groups of your organization without creating several
	 separate scheduled reports. Publishing lists are useful if you have
	 location-specific report suites and would like to provide each respective
	 department a copy of a specific dashboard. Alternatively, you can use
	 publishing lists to send data to many people without having to separately type
	 in their email addresses, if you work with a single report suite.
