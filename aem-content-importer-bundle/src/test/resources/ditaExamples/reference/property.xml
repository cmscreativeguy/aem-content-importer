  <shortdesc>Also known as a Custom Traffic Variable, Custom Insight Variable,
	 or property variable (<i>prop</i>). Props are sub-groups or subsections of
	 channels. For example, assume a web site has two channels: News and Weather.
	 The News channel can have the following four sub-groups, or properties:
	 National, Local, Sports, and Politics.

	 <p>In the interface, the menus call the reports 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> reports. These reports are based on
		traffic variables that behave the same as the predefined variables like

	 <p> Each 
		<varname>s.prop</varname> populates a custom traffic report, is case
		sensitive, limited to 100 bytes, and there are up to 75 available
		(<varname>s.prop1</varname> through 
		<varname>s.prop75</varname>). Props are used within an implementation to
		populate custom traffic reports. Unlike eVars, props do not persist beyond the
		image request. Instead, their main purpose is to determine the amount of
		traffic a certain dimension of your site received.
