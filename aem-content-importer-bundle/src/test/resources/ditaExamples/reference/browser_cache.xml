  <title>Browser Cache</title>
  <shortdesc>A browser cache is a client program (such as Microsoft Internet
	 Explorer or Firefox) that uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to send
	 requests to web servers throughout the Internet on behalf of the user. It is a
	 temporary storage location from which data can be retrieved. Data retrieval
	 from cache is usually much faster than from the server.

    <p> The Internet makes predominant use of the following caching mechanisms:

    <ul id="ul_2764C589982A4B8096881403DE051FED">
      <li id="li_D55680C017AC4A73B3415B18905EFA32">The web browser stores
		  recently downloaded pages in a temporary location on your hard drive. When you
		  return to a page you've recently viewed, the browser quickly retrieves it from
		  this local cache rather than from the original server. You can usually change
		  the size of your cache, depending on the browser you use. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_7562161D213641BEA3B66D4B72889E4D">Most ISPs use caching
		  servers on their network. When a browser requests a page, the page is
		  downloaded to the individual's computer and also saved on the caching server.
		  If a different user then requests the same page, it is retrieved from one of
		  the caching servers rather than from the site servers. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many analysis tools (especially log file analyzers) fail to count page
		views from cached pages. Reporting counts cached page views the same way it counts page
		views that have not been retrieved from cache, resulting in much more accurate
		website usage data
