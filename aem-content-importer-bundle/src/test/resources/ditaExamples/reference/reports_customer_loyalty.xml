  <title>Customer Loyalty Report</title>
  <shortdesc>The 
	 <wintitle>Customer Loyalty Report</wintitle> reveals purchasing patterns of
	 customers.

  <conbody>
    <p>The report displays purchasing patterns of customers based on three
		categories of loyalty: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_F3B547BC56994B7096313029544323D9">
      <li id="li_0787A7FB45A7457BB89DD86C230143C4">New Customer 
		</li>
      <li id="li_EA90593EF9FB445B83F94EEB7E806ED5">Return Customer 
		</li>
      <li id="li_464EE92450414A0AB7FACDAFA704B932">Loyal Customer 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although non-purchase metrics are viewable in this report (such as
		custom events, shopping cart events, and so on), the categories are always
		based on the number of orders placed. For example, a visitor might add a custom
		event named Internal Searches to the report. The 
		<wintitle>Return Customer</wintitle> line item would show the number of
		internal searches performed by visitors who have made two purchases previously,
		not the number of visitors who have made two internal searches.

      <b>Customer Loyalty Processing</b>
    </p>
    <p>The following tables define how the 
		Marketing Cloud currently processes Customer Loyalty:

    <table id="table_5FA9813FA5AE4125BB1968D693C12049">
      <tgroup cols="2">
        <colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="*" />
        <colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="*" />
        <thead>
          <row>
            <entry namest="col1" nameend="col2">Version 15 and Ad hoc analysis
				  Customer Loyalty 
				</entry>
          </row>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry colname="col1">New Customer 
				</entry>
            <entry colname="col2">0 purchases 
				</entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry colname="col1">Return Customer 
				</entry>
            <entry colname="col2">1 purchase 
				</entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry colname="col1">Loyal Customer

            <entry colname="col2">&gt;1 purchase 
				</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>
    <p>The loyalty state changes after the end of the visit where a purchase
		event occurs. For example, a New Customer (0 purchases) makes a purchase and
		then registers for a newsletter after that purchase within the same visit. The
		newsletter registration event is still considered a New Customer interaction,
		because the visitor's Customer Loyalty state will not change until the next
		visit.

    <p>The loyalty state changes immediately following the purchase event
		within the same visit. For example, a New Customer (0 purchases) makes a
		purchase and then registers for a newsletter after that purchase within the
		same visit. The newsletter registration event is considered a Return Customer
		interaction, because the visitor's customer loyalty state changed immediately
		after the purchase occurred.
