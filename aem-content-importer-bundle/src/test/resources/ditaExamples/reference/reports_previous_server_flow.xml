  <title>Previous Server Flow Report</title>
  <shortdesc>This report shows you navigation data between servers on your
	 site. When you select a server name from your site, the report shows you the
	 number of visitors who navigated to that server from each of the other servers
	 on your site within a single visit or across visits.

    <p> For example, if you have specific data on different servers or have
		mirrored data on separate servers, the report shows you the path between
		servers that the users hit. This is also true of domains within your website.
		For example, you can see how many users went from a 
		<filepath>www.mysite.com</filepath> to 
		<filepath>info.mysite.com</filepath> or<filepath>
		  sales.mysite.com</filepath>.
