  <title>Comparing Props and eVars</title> 
  <shortdesc>There are several types of variables available in the Marketing
	 Cloud. The two most popular types, Props and eVars, allow your organization to
	 report on custom dimensions to your site that standard out-of-the-box reports
	 do not offer.

	 <p>When determining which variables are assigned where, it is important to
		understand the differences between Prop and eVar functionality. Understanding
		these differences allows your organization to decide which type of variable is
		best to use. Passing the same data into both a Prop and an eVar helps obtain
		the most reporting functionality.

		<b>Props vs eVars</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The following are the main differences between props and eVars: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_79C84AD14F4A4C34B77E363259815AC7"> 
		<li id="li_1BE9479C0A7740199418937263DB5CDA"> 
		  <b>Naming convention</b>: Props are considered traffic variables,
		  meaning they are used to report on popularity of various dimensions of your
		  site. eVars are considered conversion variables. They are used to determine
		  which dimensions of your site contribute the most to success events. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_83DDCEAECEF44E56A13AB2B1AADC3881"> 
		  <b>Persistence</b>: Props do not persist beyond the image request they
		  were fired on. They cannot be associated with other variables that are not in
		  the same image request. eVars, however, are persistent. A back-end variable is
		  used to preserve the value originally fired so it can associate itself with
		  success events later on. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_95CF442EF836468DA4E335AF46C8C58A"> 
		  <b>Success events</b>: Success events, also known as conversion events,
		  are metrics that measure the number of times a visitor reaches a goal. This
		  event can be anything from purchasing something on your site, to subscribing to
		  a newsletter. eVars are designed to report on conversion events, to show you
		  which values are most successful in influencing visitors to reach your goals.
		  Traffic variables do not have this same functionality. However, you can view
		  participation metrics if you configure your report suite correctly. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_40628B665EAB48B6A4D37A6DD71DE979"> 
		  <b>Pathing</b>: Props can use pathing, which allows your organization
		  to see a given path a user took within the context of the variable being
		  viewed. An Adobe representative can enable pathing, if requested. eVars cannot
		  use pathing. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_CA185F3396254789B7144A0709EE188E"> 
		  <b>Potentially available metrics</b>: The metrics available between
		  props and eVars vary widely based on the variable's settings and data
		  platform/version. The following list illustrates what can be enabled, not what
		  is enabled by default. If you want a specific metric in reporting but do not
		  see it, have one of your organization's supported users contact Customer Care.

		  <b>Breakdowns</b>: Props use correlations, which display page views for
		  other traffic variables fired in the same image request. eVars use
		  subrelations, which provide a breakdown on other conversion variables in
		  relation to success events.
