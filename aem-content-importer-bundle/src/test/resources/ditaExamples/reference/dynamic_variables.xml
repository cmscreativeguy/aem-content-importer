  <title>Dynamic Variables</title>
  <shortdesc>Dynamic variables are shortened identifiers that correspond to
	 Analytics variables. Dynamic variables let you copy
	 values from one variable to another without typing the full values multiple
	 times in the image requests on your site.

    <p>
      <note>The following information is written primarily for developers
		  implementing 
		  marketing reports and analytics. If you have questions about
		  implementing dynamic variables, your organization's supported users should work
		  with the appropriate development resources in your organization. You can also
		  contact Adobe Customer Care. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>Dynamic variables are used when capturing the same data (for example,
		campaign tracking codes) in multiple variables concurrently. This is a common
		practice in cases where different 
		reports offer unique and important
		metrics. For example, capturing internal search keywords in a 
		<wintitle>Custom Conversion</wintitle> variable and in a 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> variable lets you view the 
		<wintitle>Revenue</wintitle> and the 
		<wintitle>Weekly Unique Visitors</wintitle> metrics associated with these
		keywords, respectively 
	 </p>
    <p>Dynamic variables are also useful for viewing data under various
		reporting conditions. A campaign tracking code can be captured in multiple
		eVars with various allocation and cookie expiration settings. This lets users
		choose the way they want to attribute conversion metrics to these campaigns. 
	 </p>
    <p>A significant benefit of dynamic variables is the ability to capture
		long strings of data in multiple variables without actually passing the long
		string repeatedly. Some browsers limit the maximum length of HTTP GET requests
		(including the Adobe image request). Using dynamic variables ensures that all
		data is captured by reducing the length of the request to Adobe servers in
		cases where data is duplicated across several variables 
	 </p>
    <p>Dynamic variables are passed by setting a variable to the desired value
		and then setting other variables to 
		<codeph>D=[variable abbreviation]</codeph>. For abbreviations for each
		variable, see 
		<xref href="r_dynamic_variable_abbreviations.xml#reference_4A05EF91AE6347669A71873770245FC4" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Variable Abbreviations?></xref>. 
	 </p>
    <p>In the Adobe image request that occurs on the page view, if you are
		using dynamic variables to copy the value of 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic 1</wintitle> to 
		<wintitle>Custom Conversion 1</wintitle>, you would see 
		<codeph>v1=D=c1</codeph>. If eVar1 received a value previously in the
		request, Adobe's servers dynamically copy the value of 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic 1</wintitle> to 
		<wintitle>Custom Conversion 1</wintitle> during data processing. As a
		result, the value originally passed using 
		<wintitle>Custom Traffic 1</wintitle> also appears in the 
		<wintitle>Custom Conversion 1</wintitle> reports.

      <li id="li_99ACFC0FFD054AFF8AABCE554DA44A08">Dynamic variables work with
		  all versions of code. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_845E7697CFAC4ED59C6A7A71A5E1DC18">As with all implementation
		  techniques, Adobe strongly recommends testing dynamic variable implementations
		  heavily in a development environment before deploying to production. Because
		  the full strings that are copied are not visible in client-side debugging
		  tools, review the affected reports to confirm successful
		  implementation. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_34EE2DC0335D446E87F203DAFB694D5D">When copying values between
		  variables with different maximum lengths, note that copying a value that
		  exceeds the maximum length of the destination variable causes truncation. For
		  example, 
		  <wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> variables have 100-character limits
		  and 
		  <wintitle>Custom Conversion</wintitle> variables have 255-characters
		  limits. When copying a 150-character value from 
		  <filepath>s.eVar1</filepath> to 
		  <filepath>s.prop1</filepath> using dynamic variables, this value is
		  truncated in the 
		  <wintitle>Custom Traffic</wintitle> report at 100 characters. For more
		  information on variable limits, see the 
		  <xref href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/index.html?f=c_sc_variables" format="http" scope="external">Implementation Guide</xref>.
