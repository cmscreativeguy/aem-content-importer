  <title>List Prop</title>
  <shortdesc>A list prop is a traffic variable that can accept multiple values
	 at once. A delimited list of values is passed into the variable, then reported
	 as individual line items. List props are most commonly implemented on pages
	 that contain user-selectable values, such as listed items with check boxes or
	 radio buttons. They are useful in any circumstance where you want to define
	 multiple values in a variable without sending multiple image requests.
