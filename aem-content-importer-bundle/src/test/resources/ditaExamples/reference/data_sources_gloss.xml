  <shortdesc>You can use Analytics to create and manage FTP-based Data Sources,
	 which leverages FTP file transfer to import offline or historical data into the
	 Marketing Cloud. After creating a Data Sources instance, the tool provides an
	 FTP location that you can use to upload Data Sources files. Once uploaded, Data
	 Sources automatically locates and processes them. After the files are
	 processed, the data is available for Analytics reporting.
