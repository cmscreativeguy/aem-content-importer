    <p>Real-Time answers the following questions: What is trending on my site,
		and why? It allows you as a marketer to quickly respond to and actively manage
		the performance of your marketing content and campaigns. The real-time data
		reported is less than two minutes latent and auto-updates on a minute-by-minute
		basis. 
	 </p>
    <p>The dashboard includes Adobe Analytics high-frequency metrics and site
		analytics to visually report traffic and page view trending of dynamic news and
		retail web sites. Real-Time understands trends in your data from minute to
		minute, within seconds of collection. It collects and streams data into an
		auto-updating UI, using real-time correlation and tracking of content and some
		conversion. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note>Real-Time requires no additional implementation or tagging. It
		  leverages your existing implementation of Adobe Analytics. To configure
		  real-time reports, see

    </p>
    <p>Two of the most prevalent usage scenarios include publishers who would
		like to promote/demote stories as user activity changes, and marketers who
		would like to track the launch of a new product line.

    <p>Keep in mind that eVars (conversion metrics) are not supported, since
		there is no concept of persistence. While you can select conversion metrics,
		they only work if they are set on the same page as the dimension(s). For more
		information, see the warning message captured in

    <p>Setting up and viewing Real-Time reports is restricted to Admins or any
		user in the "All Report Access" and "Advanced Reporting" permission groups .
		However, Real-Time does respect permissions. If, for example, you do not have
		rights to see revenue, you won't be able to view a real-time report that
		includes revenue data.
