	 <p>After you create a calculated metric, you can use it in any of your
		conversion reports (or you can use traffic calculated metrics in your traffic
		reports). Because calculated metrics are user-defined, the following table is
		not comprehensive. However, the examples show some of the popular calculated
		metrics that are used by many Adobe customers.
