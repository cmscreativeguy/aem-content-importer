		<title>Reporting Date vs. Processing Date</title> 
		<p>In the reporting user interface, the data presented is always attached
		  to the 
		  <b>Reporting Date</b>, which is the timestamp that is attached to the
		  event. 
		</p> 
		<p>Usage/Billing, on the other hand, always uses the 
		  <b>Processing Date</b>, or when the data was actually processed in the
		  system. Due to basic latency, data imports, or event time zone differences
		  (everything is processed in Pacific Time) the Reporting Date and Processing
		  Date do not typically match up completely.
