  <title>Master Marketing Profile</title>
  <shortdesc>The Master Marketing Profile provides the ability for Adobe
	 Marketing Cloud solutions to communicate and share information about website
	 visitors so the same data can be used by each solution. The Master Marketing
	 Profile eliminates the need for customers to use their visitors and their
	 visitor web sessions as the integration point between the solutions by moving
	 the integration point to the Adobe Marketing Cloud.
