  <shortdesc>A tracked activity. An 
	 <i>event</i> is also called a 
	 <i>success event</i>. It is defined as a point on your website in which a
	 successful conversion occurs. For example, if a product is added to the
	 customer’s shopping cart, the 
	 <varname>scAdd</varname> event is used to capture that success event. Think
	 of events as 
	 <term>conversion metrics</term>.

    <p>Adobe offers both Predefined Events and Custom Events. The Predefined
		Events are related to retail conversions and have specific names (discussed
		later in the chapter). Custom Events can be used for any purpose and are
		commonly used for conversion activities such as registrations, subscriptions,
		downloads, form completions, sign- ups, and so on. They can even be used in a
		retail solution to fill in gaps in the checkout process that go beyond what is
		provided with the Predefined Events.
