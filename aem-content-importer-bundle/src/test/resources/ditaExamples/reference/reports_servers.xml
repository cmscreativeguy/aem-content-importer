  <title>Servers Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Lets you group pages that are hosted by a particular server. This
	 report lists all of the servers of your website, and
	 tells you which servers are being accessed the most. For example, if you have a
	 website that is hosted on two different servers, you might want to see if one
	 server is serving more impressions than the other server.
