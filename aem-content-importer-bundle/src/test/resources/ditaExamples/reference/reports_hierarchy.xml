  <title>Hierarchy Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Displays the hierarchical layout of the pages on your website and
	 displays those pages in order based on how they are configured in the 
	 <varname>hierN</varname> variable. This report is populated using proper
	 variable configuration that you set for each page that you want to take part in
	 the hierarchy. This report lets you see selected metrics (such as Unique
	 Visitors) for the hierarchy.

    <p>By specifying the hierarchy depth (the default is 10 levels), you can
		view the overall hierarchy, as well as the position and data for specific pages
		in the selected hierarchy. You can specify names for your hierarchies and,
		depending on the service level you have purchased, view hierarchies according
		to Page Views, Visits, or Visitors.
