    <p>Because each report suite differs, this set of reports is
		used differently for each client. A Custom Event report can be
		used as a counter that shows the number of times an event occurs. For example,
		if 
		<uicontrol>event1</uicontrol> is set to count the number of times a
		document is downloaded, then the Custom Event report for Event 1 shows the
		total number of times the event (or download) occurs. You can have multiple
		custom event reports.
