  <title>Checkouts</title>
  <shortdesc> An event that occurs when customers arrive at the checkout stage
	 of a purchase. The checkout stage usually occurs just before a purchase is
	 finalized, and usually involves the customer entering personal information
	 (such as their shipping and billing information). You have control over the
	 events on your site that qualify as checkouts. This value comes from the 
	 <codeph>scCheckout</codeph> event.
