	 <wintitle>Advanced Segment Insight</wintitle> (ASI) is a legacy version 14
	 feature that is replaced by native segmentation in analytics reports.

  <conbody> 
	 <note>The ASI interface is not available in marketing reports &amp;
		analytics. 
	 </note> 
	 <p>ASI slots are no longer processing after you upgrade to Analytics.
		However, most use cases should be resolved through segmentation. Here are a few
		distinctions to be aware of: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Interface</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>For more information on the Analytics marketing reports segment
		interface, see the 
		<xref
		 href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/segment/"
		 format="http" scope="external">Analytics Segmentation Guide</xref>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Data Availability</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>ASI processes from a specified date forward. Creating a segment for
		historical data is possible but time consuming. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> Marketing report segments apply to all data on the new platform, as of
		your upgrade date. After you create a segment, you can immediately apply it to
		a report. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Processing vs. Filtering</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>ASI reprocesses data. This can cause some data discrepancies due to eVar
		persistence and similar factors. As such, VISTA rules running on the ASI report
		suite can change the data, rather than just filter out some traffic. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> Marketing report segments act as filters at the Visit, Visitor, or Hit
		level. Rather than re-processing data, the filters remove data that falls
		outside of the criteria. As such, VISTA rules cannot change the data in a
		report segment. (If you need to re-process data after upgrading, contact
		Engineering Services.) 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Permissions</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>With ASI, users can be restricted to see just one or more ASI report
		suites, if needed. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Segment permissions in marketing reports differ between
