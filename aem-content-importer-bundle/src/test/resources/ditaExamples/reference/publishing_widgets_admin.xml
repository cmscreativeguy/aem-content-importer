  <title> Publishing Widget </title> 
  <shortdesc> A Publishing Widget is a container that lets you embed marketing
	 reports (bookmarks and dashboards) on a web page. People in your organization
	 who do not have access to marketing reports can view pertinent data. 
  </shortdesc>

  </prolog> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>For example, you could provide a dashboard so company executives can
		view the number of page visitors, the number of unique page visitors, and so
		on. 
	 </p> 
	 <note type="warning"> No authentication is required to view data published
		through the Publishing Widget. Because of this, you should consider published
		data to be no more secure than data sent to an email group or list server. Use
		the widget only in compliance with your organization's security standards,
		existing contractual requirements, and applicable law. The Publishing Widget
		provides the ability to restrict, by IP address or domain path, where you can
		publish data. However, these mechanisms are intended solely to prevent
		unintended data distribution, and are not an effective way to secure access to
		data distributed through the Publishing Widget. 
		<p>Adobe assumes no responsibility or liability for data exposed through
		  the Publishing Widget. 
		</p> 
	 </note> 
	 <p>Because Publishing Widget can potentially drive high traffic volumes,
		Adobe reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to disable a company's
		Publishing widgets for improper use or excessive traffic that is causing an
		impact to overall performance. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Troubleshooting - Publishing Widget Cache</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The first time any user sees the deployed publishing widget, the widget
		runs the report. After the report is run, the results are added to a cache and
		are valid for 1 hour. Any subsequent user who views the publishing widget
		within the next hour will see the cached version (it will return instantly).
		After an hour has passed, any subsequent user who views the publishing widget
		will force it to run the report again, and then these results are cached, and
		so on. That way, the data is guaranteed to be at most one hour old. 
	 </p>
	 <p>If you see data differences between the Publishing Widget and the
		reporting interface, you might need to clear the Publishing Widget cache.
