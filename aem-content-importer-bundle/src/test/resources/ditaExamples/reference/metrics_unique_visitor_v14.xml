	 who visits a site for the first time within a specified time period. For
	 example, the unique visitor can visit a site ten times in a week, but if the
	 time period is Week, a single unique visitor is counted only once for that
	 week. After that week is ended, that unique visitor can be counted again for a
	 different time period.
