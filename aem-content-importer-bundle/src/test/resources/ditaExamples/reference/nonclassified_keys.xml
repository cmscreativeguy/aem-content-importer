  <title>Non-Classified Keys</title>
  <shortdesc>Non-classified keys are grouped together in classification reports
	 as a single line item labeled 
	 <term>None</term>. It can be useful to rename 
	 <term>None</term> to something more descriptive.

    <p> For example, suppose your tracking codes contain information that
		delineates the type of mobile campaign the tracking code is associated with.
		You are using classification (Mobile Campaign Type) to group these tracking
		codes into categories such as Mobile Web, iOS Application, Android Application,
		and so on. Some campaigns might not be mobile campaigns and are therefore not
		classified with a mobile campaign type. All non-classified tracking codes would
		be grouped under 
		<term>None</term> in the 
		<wintitle>Mobile Campaign Type</wintitle> report.
