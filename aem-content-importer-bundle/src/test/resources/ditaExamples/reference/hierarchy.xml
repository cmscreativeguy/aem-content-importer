  <title>Hierarchy</title> 
  <shortdesc>The hierarchy variable is used to determine the location of a page
	 in your site’s hierarchy or page structure. Hierarchies reflect the natural
	 organization of the site. The hierarchy variable is most useful for sites that
	 have many levels in the site structure. For example, a media site may have four
	 levels to the Sports section: Sports, Local Sports, Baseball, Red Sox. If
	 someone visits the Baseball page, then Sports, Local Sports and Baseball
	 reflect that visit.
