  <title>Calculated Metric</title>
  <shortdesc>Calculated metrics enable you to combine metrics to create
	 mathematical operations that are used as new metrics. These metrics can be
	 created for a report to which you add metrics. Administrators can create
	 calculated metrics for all users of a report suite.

    <p>For example, you can create a metric that subtracts the Keyword Cost and
		the Cost of Goods from Revenue. This calculated metric lets you see the net
		revenue. You could then divide this value by Total Orders to see the average
		net revenue per order.
