  <title>Web Beacon</title>
  <shortdesc>A web beacon, also known as a 
	 <filepath>clear.gif</filepath>, is a transparent graphic image, no larger
	 than 1x1 pixel. It is placed on a web site or in an email to track visitor
	 behavior. 
	 The web beacon points to a server, known as
	 2o7.net, to retrieve the image. The image, when loaded into the user's browser,
	 loads JavaScript code that performs several functions, one of which is to check
	 for a cookie. If a cookie is not loaded, it loads one on the browser. If the
	 user does not have cookies enabled, a web beacon cannot track activity. The web
	 beacon for a non-cookied user accounts for an anonymous visit, but the user's
	 unique information is not recorded. The JavaScript code also collects variables
	 (particular to the selected web site) from the code and sends them to 
	 analytics reporting.</shortdesc>
