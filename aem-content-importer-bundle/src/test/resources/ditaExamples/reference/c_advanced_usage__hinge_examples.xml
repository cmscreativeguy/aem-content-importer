  <title>Advanced Usage: Hinge Examples</title>
  <shortdesc>The 
	 <wintitle>hinge</wintitle> field determines how the value is distributed
	 when the report is broken down. The most common use of 
	 <wintitle>hinge</wintitle> is if the rate is fixed, and you want to
	 determine which event should determine the distribution of the value. 
	 <wintitle>Hinge</wintitle> can also be used with the rate in various ways.
