      <p>Sometimes a specific report is recommended by Customer Care to assist in
		  retrieving data you are looking for. If your organization has customized the
		  report suite's menu structure, sometimes these reports can be difficult to

			 feature to locate your report. Selecting a report within the interactive menu
			 shows the name, default name, type (folder or link), and its visibility status.
			 It is possible to locate any report by searching for its default menu name.
			 This is the most comprehensive way, as it will also show you reports that have
			 been hidden.

			 users. If they are not able to help, they can create a ticket to request
			 Customer Care's assistance.
