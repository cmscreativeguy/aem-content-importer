		<p>Because some of the data that is displayed on the current data view
		  has not been fully processed, you will see a slight difference between values
		  reported on the current data view and the finalized view. On trended reports,
		  the data difference is typically within 1%.

		<title>Calculated Metrics</title> 
		<p>Since calculated metrics can be created using metrics that have
		  different latency, some recent values might be calculated using incomplete data
		  in the current data view. For example, let's say you created a "Page Views per
		  Visit" calculated metric with the following formula: 
		</p> 
		<codeblock>Page Views/Visits</codeblock> 
		<p>Since Page Views typically appear within 10 minutes, and Visits
		  typically appear within 2 hours, calculated metrics within this latency window
		  are calculated using incomplete metrics. If you post a new page that gets 4000
		  hits from 4000 different visits over a 2 hour time frame, the latency
		  difference between these metrics can cause incomplete calculations for the
		  latest hour or two:

		<p>This is most visible when reporting on new values, or on very short
		  time frames. When you are reporting over longer periods, the latency
		  differences that occur in the last few hours of reporting are unlikely to have
		  any noticeable impact on calculated metrics. 
		</p> 
		<p>If you have calculated metrics that might be impacted by these
		  differences, either turn current data off, or add the metrics used in the
		  calculation directly to the report so you can see the latency values for each
