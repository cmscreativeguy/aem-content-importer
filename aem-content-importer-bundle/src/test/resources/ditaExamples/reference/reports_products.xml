              <p> Shows averages for the Product Views, Cart Additions, Orders,
					 Units, and Revenue metrics. It also shows key conversions between important
					 data in each reporting group and standard conversion metrics (Orders, Units,
					 and Revenue). The top (overview) of the funnel provides a visual summary of
					 conversion data. The funnel section shows statistics for all events in the
					 overview section based on Orders and up to two other metrics, such as Revenue
					 and Units.

					 click a

					 header.

              <p>Because the current time periods are not yet completed when
					 you view data, this report can indicate a downward trend from the previous to
					 the current time period. For example, there can be fewer visits today than
					 yesterday, but only because the rest of the time period’s statistics have yet
					 to occur.
