	 These methods include tracking information in real-time from web sites, emails,
	 campaigns, web-based kiosks, mobile devices, client-server applications, and
	 most applications that can access the Internet.

					 <p>Today most digital analytics platforms use JavaScript tags
						to collect data from web sites and other web-based systems. This approach
						involves placing client-side JavaScript code within your web pages, which sends
						page, browser, and visitor data to Analytics. Most implementations leverage
						this approach. 
					 </p> 
					 <p>Increasingly, organizations use tag management solutions
						such as tag management to deploy and manage their various JavaScript tags,
						including their page code. 
					 </p> 
					 <p>All Analytics customers have access to 
						<xref href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/"

						standard method to deploy Marketing Cloud tags.

				  <entry colname="col1"> AppMeasurement Libraries 
				  </entry> 
				  <entry colname="col2"> 
					 <p> AppMeasurement libraries provide a mechanism for data
						collection when the JavaScript tag method isn't compatible with the device,
						application, or system to be tracked. 
					 </p> 
					 <p>Adobe has released AppMeasurement libraries for mobile
						devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), rich media (Flash-Flex, Silverlight),
						and other languages/frameworks (Java, .NET, PHP, XML). All of these libraries
						leverage the Data Insertion API to pass data to reporting, which can also be
						used for batch uploads or delayed data collection. 
					 </p> 
					 <p> AppMeasurement libraries use cases include: 
					 </p> 
					 <p> 
					 <ul id="ul_E782058BFE3348E3964E8C8A746BE07E">

						  confirmation server-side from a back-end transactional system to reduce order

						</li> 
					 </ul> 
					 </p> 
					 <p>To link a visitor's behavior across JavaScript and tagless
						data collection, you may need to generate your own visitor ID (unique
						identifier for a particular visitor) so that the AppMeasurement and JavaScript
						values match. Without a tie to a common visitor ID, AppMeasurement data is
						typically collected in a separate report suite. 
					 </p>

				  <entry colname="col1"> Classifications 
				  </entry> 
				  <entry colname="col2"> 
					 <p> Classifications enables you to upload metadata for custom
						variables (prop or eVar). Metadata is data about data or attributes about your
						data. For a particular campaign tracking code, article ID, or product ID, you
						can assign multiple classifications to define or aggregate your data in various
						ways. For example, for each campaign tracking code you can specify the
						marketing channel, offer type, featured product, ad placement, creative type,
						and so on. Each classification generates its own unique report, which can be
						broken down by other attributes or dimensions. 
					 </p> 
					 <p> Classifications are retroactive. If you want to reclassify
						or change some metadata values, you can replace the classification file with an
						updated version. While many attributes are text-based (brand, color, size), a
						special form of classification (Numeric 2) allows you to create metrics (cost
						of goods sold) that can have different values for different time periods. 
					 </p> 
					 <p>See

				  <entry colname="col1">Data Sources 
				  </entry> 
				  <entry colname="col2"> 
					 <p>You can import other forms of time-based data. Use Data
						Sources to upload offline metrics and to import data from other digital
						marketing systems, such as your email or ad serving vendor. In the upload
						process, you specify and map the metrics and data dimensions to particular
						custom events and eVars for reporting and analysis purposes. 
					 </p> 
					 <p>There are two main types of Data Source uploads. First, you
						can upload summary data, which attaches offline metrics to a subset of
						specified reports (eVars). Second, the Transaction ID method enables you to
						link an offline event to an online event through a unique transaction
						identifier that is set when an online event occurs, such as a lead form
						submission. The advantage of transaction ID data is that your uploaded metrics
						are fully integrated with the rest of your marketing reports rather than a few
						designated reports with summary data uploads. 
					 </p> 
					 <p>Here are some common examples of how companies use Data
						Sources: 
					 </p> 
					 <ul id="ul_8980EAEA2915499ABA548C0653988D00"> 
						<li id="li_265D4016324340ACB873995B4C96DA4E">Upload campaign
						  metrics (ad impressions, campaign cost, etc.) via summary data tied to campaign
						  tracking codes 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_EB93ECA4780F4F779F8F6ECE59051B2D">Import cost of
						  goods sold data via transaction ID to analyze gross margin performance 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_55DB8B18067143CAB5DDD32510F30009">Tie product
						  returns via transaction ID to close the gap between gross sales and net sales 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_08C218A077EB4272B18887DCE09268A6">Upload closed
						  offline sales via transaction ID to understand what online tactics and
						  behaviors are closing business deals, not just generating leads 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_BD49ED209906490BA26D613A96024463">Bring in
						  financial loan approvals, declines, and loan value from offline processing via
						  transaction ID 
						</li> 
						<li id="li_81F4D319EFBC492BA60D3EB1163524DE">Import CRM data
						  for data that may change over time, such as customer lifetime value, customer
						  type (silver/gold/platinum), location, etc. via transaction ID 
						</li> 
					 </ul> 
					 <p>A third type of Data Source upload is known as 
						<i>fully processed data</i>, which is used in limited cases
						for post-collection batch uploads (tied to visitor ID or IP/user agent). It is
						handled as if it were received by Adobe's data collection servers at the time
						specified. The uploaded data is indistinguishable from your normal report data,
						and there is not a mechanism to delete the data if it is erroneous.
