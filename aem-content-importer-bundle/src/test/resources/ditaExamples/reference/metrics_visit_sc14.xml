  <title>Visits in version 14</title> 
  <shortdesc>A visit begins when a visitor first views a page on your company's
	 website. The visit continues until the visitor stops activity on the site for
	 30 minutes, or until the maximum visit length occurs, which is 12 hours.

	 <p>For example, if you visit a page on 
		<filepath>www.adobe.com</filepath>, you have one instance of a visit that
		lasts until you have incurred 30 minutes of inactivity. Closing your browser
		window does not automatically end the current visit. If you do not view any
		pages for more than 30 minutes, and then resume viewing pages, marketing
		reports register a new visit. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> Marketing reports measure visits by a calculation based on the unique
		visitor cookie, the page views by that visitor, and the visit time-out period.
		The unique visitor cookie helps to prevent recounting. If a browser does not
		accept persistent cookies, the report does not calculate a visit for that
		visitor. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The maximum length of any visit is 12 hours. No visit is allowed to
		extend beyond that period. If additional activity occurs for a period longer
		than 12 hours, with no period of inactivity exceeding 30 minutes, the visit
		will be counted twice. The new visit is counted at the first page view after
		the 12 hour length has been exceeded. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The 30 minute visit timeout period is an industry standard. It is used
		by most web analytics products and it is recommended by industry analysts. Upon
		request, this time period may be customized by report suite. Contact Customer
		Care to request a different inactivity threshold value. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Time Periods</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p> A visit is reported only during the time period in which the visit is
		initiated. For example, suppose that a visit begins at 11:45 p.m. on December
		1st, and continues until 12:30 a.m. on December 2nd. The visit is counted only
		on December 1st. This reporting applies to other time periods, including
		weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.
