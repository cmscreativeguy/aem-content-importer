  <title>Single Page Visit Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Not to be mistaken with the 
	 <wintitle>Single Page Visits</wintitle> metric in 
	 ad hoc analysis, the 
	 <wintitle>Single Page Visits</wintitle> report shows the pages your website
	 visitors enter and exit, without taking steps to view any other pages.

    <p>This report is most commonly used in the context of the 
		<wintitle>Pages</wintitle> report, however it can also be viewed in all
		traffic variables with 
		<wintitle>pathing</wintitle> enabled. You can use this report to identify
		entry pages that are least likely to compel a visitor to explore your site
		further, or to determine how many visits consist of a single page. This
		information lets you optimize content to reduce exits on those pages.
