  <title>Segmentation</title> 
  <shortdesc>Segments are custom subsets of data, or data filtered by rules
	 that you create. Segments are based on hits, visits, and visitors. For example,
	 you can run a 
	 <wintitle>Pages Report</wintitle> and then apply a 
	 <wintitle>Visitors from Mobile Devices</wintitle> segment.

	 <p>Unified Analytics segmentation lets you build, manage, share, and apply
		powerful, focused audience segments to your reports using Analytics
		capabilities, the Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Target, and other integrated
		Adobe products.

		<title> Target </title> 
		<p> Target uses segment filters, which are groups of visitors who share a
		  specific characteristic or set of characteristics. For example, visitors who
		  arrive at your page from a certain search engine might be one segment. Other
		  segments might be based on gender, age, location, registration status, purchase
		  history, or just about any other detail you can collect about your visitors.
		  Use segment filters to divide visitor traffic, and compare experience
		  performance for each traffic segment.

		<p>You can create a segment of the elements of any countable dimension
		  and then output data for that segment on a batch or ongoing real-time basis
		  into a tab-delimited file. Each time that you export a segment, you output
		  metric or dimension data for all of the dimension elements included in that
		  segment. You can control how the output data is formatted so that other systems
		  can easily load the data.

		<title> Audience Management </title> 
		<p> A segment (or audience) defines a set of users who share similar
		  attributes. In audience management, segments help you classify people into
		  related subgroups based on server-side rules you create in 
		  <wintitle>Segment Builder</wintitle>. 
		</p> 
		<p>For example, segment rules can evaluate people based on customer type
		  (casual browser vs. serious purchaser), geography, demographics, and many other
		  characteristics. Segmentation is useful when you need to target products and
		  services to specific groups with similar interests and behavior.
