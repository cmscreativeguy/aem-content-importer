  <title>Reporting High Numbers of Unique Values (Low-Traffic)</title> 
  <shortdesc>When a report has a large number of unique values, marketing
	 reports provide functionality to ensure that the most important values appear
	 in your report. 
  </shortdesc>

  </prolog> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>At the beginning of each calendar month, Analytics reports include the
		first 500,000 values received for any single variable in reports. This includes
		page names, and other traffic and commerce variables. For example, each unique
		page name on your site counts toward this total. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>After 500,000 unique values are received, Analytics reports begin to
		optimize which values are displayed in reports. When new values are received
		after this threshold, the system initially groups these values in a single line
		item in reports titled "(Low-Traffic)". (note: this line item was previously
		titled "Uniques Exceeded".) 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If one of these values begins to receive significant traffic, the value
		is reported as a separate line item along with the first 500,000 values for the
		remainder of the month (the first 500,000 values are always reported separately
		regardless of traffic). 
	 </p>
	 <p> If a variable value receives enough traffic so that it's no longer
		listed as (Low-Traffic), the first values bucketed in this line item don't move
		to its respective line item. Those first 10-100 instances stay under
		(Low-Traffic).
	 </p> 
	 <p>If the number of unique values exceed 1 million in a single month, a
		second threshold is applied which requires more traffic before a value is
		reported as a separate line item. For example, a new page that starts to
		receive 100 hits per day will be reported as a separate line item, but a new
		page that receives fewer than 10 hits might not. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Threshold limits are 500,000 and 1 million unique values by default. All
		values, including each unique value in "(low-traffic)", are available in
		DataWarehouse reports. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> If you have a custom unique value limit, the following applies:

		<li id="li_39AC6ED3EB624400A7CF1D0E54852210">If you have a uniques limit
		  set to less than 500,000, your limit is used for both the lower and upper
		  thresholds. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_D9E1FD47AF3E4A44B577C634327160EB"> If you have a uniques limit
		  set between 500,000 and 1,000,000 today, your limit is used for the lower
		  threshold and 1,000,000 for the upper threshold. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_2F0FAD270808495186057D09B8A92BD9">If you have a uniques limit
		  set above 1,000,000 today, your limit is used for both the lower and upper
		  thresholds.

	 </ul>

		<title>Segments</title> 
		<p>Low-traffic values are always included in data warehouse segments, but
		  are not included in ad hoc analysis or marketing reports &amp; analytics
		  segments. 
		</p> 
		<p>If a value receives enough traffic to appear in reports, values
		  received from that time until the end of the month appear in ad hoc analysis
		  and marketing reports &amp; analytics segments. For example, if a value is
		  low-traffic on Monday but is in reports on Tuesday, the segment will only
		  include the Tuesday data.

	 <section id="section_8F1352C1DBA44199A85D272FC201BFF7"> 
		<title>Classifications</title> 
		<p>Low-traffic values cannot be classified. If a value receives enough
		  traffic to appear in reports, it can be classified from that point until the
		  end of the month.
