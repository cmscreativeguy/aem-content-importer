      <title>Visits Metric Includes Non-cookie Visitors</title>
      <p>To calculate the Visits metric, version 14 reported only on
		  visitors who accepted a tracking cookie. Version 15 more accurately
		  measures Visits by including visitors who do not accept a tracking cookie. As a
		  result, the Visits metric in most cases reports a larger value when compared to
		  previous versions under the same circumstances.
		</p>
      <p>This change affects any report that uses the Visits metric, including
		  Path reports and calculated metrics. Calculated metric values can increase or
		  decrease, depending on whether 
		  <i>Visits</i> is the denominator or numerator in the calculation. For
		  example, in an 
		  <i>Orders / Visit</i> calculation the value is likely to decrease. In
		  Visits / Visitor, the value is likely to increase.

      <p>To see the percentage of users who do not accept persistent cookies:
		</p>
      <p>1. Click 
		  <uicontrol>Site Metrics</uicontrol> &gt; 
		  <uicontrol>Visitors</uicontrol> &gt; 
		  <uicontrol>Unique Visitors</uicontrol>.
		</p>
      <p>2. Click 
		  <uicontrol>Filter: Persistent Cookies</uicontrol>.
		</p>
      <p>The non-persistent cookie visitors are added to the results. You can
		  download the report to CSV or Excel and divide the non-persistent cookie
		  visitors by total visitors. This represents the percent by which the visits
		  will increase after you upgrade to Version 15. This increase ranges from
		  0.2% (for report suites fed entirely by first party cookies) to 11-14% for
		  report suites entirely on third party cookies.

      <title>Updated Visits Metric for Typed Bookmarked in Referring Domains
		  Report </title>
      <p>If you had the Visits metric enabled on the Referring Domains report
		  in v14, you will notice a change to the Visit count on this report after
		  upgrading to v15.
		</p>
      <p>In v14, Typed/Bookmarked was counted anytime a visit contained a
		  server call with no referrer specified, regardless of where the server call
		  occurred during the visit.
		</p>
      <p>Since the referrer can often be empty mid-visit due to actions such as
		  Flash navigation and redirects, v15 was improved to count Typed/Bookmarked only
		  when a visit starts with a server call with no referrer specified. 
		</p>
      <p>With this change, in v15 Instances of Typed/Bookmarked should match
		  Visits, whereas, in v14, Instances were typically lower than Visits.
