  <title>Custom Traffic Variable (s.prop)</title>
  <shortdesc>Custom traffic variables, also called props (s.prop) or property
	 variables, are counters that count the number of times each value is sent into
	 Analytics.

  <conbody>
    <p>Props also let you correlate custom data with specific traffic-related
		events. These variables are embedded in the Analytics code on each page of your
		website. Through s.prop variables, Analytics lets you create custom reports,
		unique to your organization, industry, and business objectives. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, if you are an automobile manufacturer, you may be
		interested in seeing "Most Popular Car Model" to complement your "Pages"
		report. You can accomplish this by allocating one of your traffic properties to
		represent car model. Then implement your code to pass in car model on the
		appropriate pages. 
	 </p>
    <note>Analytics supports up to 75 s.prop variables. 
	 </note>
    <p> You can enable and name these variables in Admin Tools under 
		<uicontrol>Analytics</uicontrol> &gt; 
		<uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> &gt; 
		<uicontrol>Report Suites</uicontrol> &gt; 
		<uicontrol>Edit Settings</uicontrol> &gt;
