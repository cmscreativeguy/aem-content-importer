  <title>Screen Size Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Groups mobile device hits to your site by the screen size of the
	 device. The report shows each screen size, the number of visitors to your site
	 that used each screen size, and each screen size as a percentage of the total
	 views. The Screen Size report shows both the height and width of the screen
	 size as compared to the Screen Height report and Screen Width report.

    <p>The reported screen size does not indicate the orientation of the
		device. Regardless of screen orientation, each device has a fixed screen
		resolution in the report. This size is based on research that determines which
		orientation is more likely. This means you might see sizes such as 768x1024 and
		1024x768 in the same report with each size representing one or more different
		devices.
