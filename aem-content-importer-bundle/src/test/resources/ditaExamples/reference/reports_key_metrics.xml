          <b>Use Cases</b>
        </p>
        <p>Social Media: You can use the Key Metrics Report to examine social
			 groups, such as Total Mentions or Audience Sentiment, and see how they are
			 affecting revenue. How do you tie key metrics like Revenue to Social metrics?
			 Look at the KM report by those groupings--total mentions, total audience,
			 mapped to revenue. i.e. tv grouping, computing grouping, to see if it spikes or
			 drives revenue.
