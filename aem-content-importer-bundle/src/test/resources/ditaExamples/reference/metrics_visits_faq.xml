            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>The Cookies Report measures first party cookies, or those
					 cookies that are set on the web site's domain. JavaScript sets and tests the
					 cookie, which is named s_cc.

				  </p>
            </entry>
            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>Internet Services Providers and large corporations share a
					 limited number of IP addresses among multiple users at the same time. Under IP
					 pooling, a single user may appear to the web server to be using multiple IP
					 addresses in a single session. Solely relying upon IP addresses is misleading
					 when calculating both Unique Visitors and Visits.

              <p>How does Analytics track Spiders and Bots?
				  </p>
            </entry>
            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>Marketing reports require supported browsers to execute
					 JavaScript, render the page, and request and load images. Since most spiders
					 and bots do not load images, they are not tracked. If a spider can execute
					 JavaScript and load images, reporting tracks the spider as a visitor. You
					 can also exclude spiders by IP address or by using a VISTA rule to exclude by
					 domain.

              <p>How does reporting track a visitor who uses multiple

				  </p>
            </entry>
            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>Since browsers do not share cookies, reporting tracks a
					 visitor as unique for each browser used.

              <p>Why does the Cookies Report show 2% of visitors as having
					 cookies disabled when non-persistent cookie visitors are 10% of total visitors?
				  </p>
            </entry>
            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>The Cookies Report cannot be compared to the Unique Visitors
					 Reports because they are measured by different types of cookies ("first party"
					 vs. "third party" cookies). The Cookies Report measures those visitors who
					 enable first-party cookies, or the visitors that enable the site itself to set
					 cookies.
				  </p>
              <p>The Unique Visitors metric relies on third party cookies,
					 which are set by the reporting domain. Additionally, as explained above, the
					 non-persistent cookie visitors may be overstated due to the limits of using the
					 IP address to identify visitors, and the effect of IP pooling.

            </entry>
            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>Visitors refer to Daily Unique Visitors. For example, if you
					 select multiple calendar days when running a report with the Visitors metric,
					 the data shows the sum of Daily Unique Visitors for the selected days. This
					 does not apply to the Hourly Unique Visitors Report, Weekly Unique Visitors
					 Report, Monthly Unique Visitors Report, Quarterly Unique Visitors Report, and
					 Yearly Unique Visitors Report.

				  </p>
            </entry>

              <p>You can use the Data Warehouse to report unique visitors
					 across specific segments and time frames.

              <p>Why is the number of daily unique visitors greater than the
					 number of visits?
				  </p>
            </entry>
            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>Occasionally, a web site's traffic may contain a higher number
					 of non-cookied users than normal. A non-cookied user cannot be counted as a
					 visit because reporting cannot place a cookie on their browser, but
					 reporting still counts them as a daily unique visitor based on IP address
					 and user agent string. Additionally, if a visitor that does not support cookies
					 obtains multiple IP addresses within a single session, the visitor may be
					 counted multiple times.

					 Tagging?
				  </p>
            </entry>
            <entry colname="col2">
              <p>Multi-suite tagging sends a single page view to multiple
					 reporting report suites. For each report suite ID used within the code on a
					 page, a unique cookie will be set. reporting tracks the visitor separately
					 and uniquely for each report suite.
