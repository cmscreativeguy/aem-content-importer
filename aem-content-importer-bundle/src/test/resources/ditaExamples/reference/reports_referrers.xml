  <title>Referrers Report</title> 
  <shortdesc>Displays the domain or URL where your visitors came from before
	 they arrived at your site, the methods visitors use to find your website, and
	 the number of visits to your site that came from these referring locations.

  <conbody> 
	 <p>For example, if a visitor clicks a link from Site A and arrives at your
		site, Site A is the referrer if it is not defined as part of your domain.
		During implementation, your implementation consultant can help you to define
		the domains and URLs that are part of your website. (This change can be done
		after implementation.) 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Domains or URLs that are not part of those defined domains and URLs are
		considered referrers. For example, web page A and web page B are added to the
		internal URL filter, but web page C is not. In this case, web page C is
		considered a referrer.
