  <title>Use Case - Extracting Visitor IDs</title>
  <shortdesc>Data warehouse provides a feature that allows you to extract a
	 list of visitor IDs. These IDs are not 
	 cookie IDs, but IDs that you capture in one
	 of your conversion variables. Although there are other ways to get at this
	 information, the following example is a shortcut to generating a data warehouse
	 request.

    <p>For example, assume that your business sends marketing e-mails to
		customers and prospects. Each of these e-mail recipients has a unique ID in
		your e-mail system (such as 
		<term>EMAIL Contact ID</term>). You set up your e-mails so that when
		contacts receive an e-mail and click one of its links, the visitor arrives at
		your website with a campaign ID and a unique EMAIL Contact ID. For example,
		your e-mail link may resolve to:
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">http://www.test.com/?cid=springmailblast&amp;mid=1363660158</codeblock>
    <p> Setting these in conversion variables (eVars) allows you to see how
		each e-mail performed (through the campaign ID) and how often each e-mail
		recipient visited the site (through the EMAIL Contact ID).
	 </p>
    <p> Assume you are capturing these IDs. Most marketers want to segment
		their website behavior and then see if they can re-market to those who meet
		certain criteria. For example, you may want to send a re-marketing e-mail to
		all e-mail recipients who came to your site from the e-mail and viewed (or
		completed) a website form. To do this, find a way to identify the EMAIL Contact
		IDs of those completing the specific form. 
	 </p>
    <p>One way to do this is to use a Conversion Subrelation report to break
		down the Form ID eVar value by the EMAIL Contact ID eVar. However, a pre-built
		feature is available to do this using Data
		Warehouse. This feature allows you to tell 
		which eVar stores your Unique User IDs
		(EMAIL Contact ID in this case) and allows you to easily extract those IDs
		using data warehouse. By using this feature, you can automatically create a
		data warehouse request that pulls the Unique Visitor IDs for which you are
		interested.
