  <title>Next Page Flow Report</title> 
  <shortdesc>Displays path views, or the number of times and percentages that a
	 page was viewed within the constraints of the paths. For example, a Privacy
	 Policy page might have 10,000 total page views, but only 500 of those page
	 views occurred immediately before a Home Page. In this case, you would see 500
	 path views. You can view the report at the visit or visitor level. Percentages
	 for each page are displayed beside the name of the page. The width of a line
	 connected to a page depicts the relative percentage of visits.
