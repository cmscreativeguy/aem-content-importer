    <p>Not to be mistaken with global report suites, rollups provide a
		convenient place to see summed totals such as Page Views, Revenue, or
		Technology metrics. Rollups are frequently used because they do not require
		additional implementation.

      <p>
        <b>Global report suite</b>: Implementation is altered to send image
		  requests across domains into a single global report suite, in addition to
		  individual report suites. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b> Rollup report suite</b>: Created in Admin Tools. Takes the
		  sum of each metric at the end of every day. 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_97E4CD8FD46F4BCC9D85B71B8937EA9C">
        <li id="li_60A1F74911C04CE6B1C7A26356BD4555">Rollups are free to use
			 and do not increment any server calls. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_716BDECF109941A1BC9BA488860F2CAD">Rollups provide total
			 data, but do not report individual values in reports. For example, eVar1 values
			 are not included, but its aggregate total can be. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_24813A6A3DE642C9BF3434CEEAB3B45B">Data is not deduplicated
			 when combining data across report suites. A single user can touch three
			 different report suites in a single day, and would appear as three daily unique
			 visitors in the rollup. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_7B67C11F7D5348B4B198338A05BA2523">Rollup aggregation happens
			 on a nightly basis. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_73AAA12505474363BE8899ED84C2B440">When adding a report suite
			 to an existing rollup, historical data is not included in the rollup. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_3D2EBC81BDA64B9C907A830C921B7254">Rollup report suites have
			 limited reporting capabilities. For example, unique visitor counts are added
			 across report suites. If the same person visits two separate report suites, a
			 rollup lists that person as two visitors, whereas a standard global report
			 suite shows one visitor. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_1A88B8F0A6484A518D83DF6D662B3D7C">All child report suites
			 must have data in them in order for a rollup to function. If new report suites
			 are included in a rollup, make sure to send at least one page view to those
			 report suites. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_E86254E36A5142CDB4A693D4A1E15FD8">Rollup report suites are
			 limited to a maximum of 40 child report suites.

        <li id="li_7C4CB64C1CF84AABBA73F96B571F71B2">Data contained in Rollup
			 report suites does not support subrelations, segments, or any metrics that were
			 introduced in 
			 marketing reports.

      <title>Rollup vs. Global Report Suites</title>
      <p>
        <b>Server calls</b>: Global report suites increment secondary server
		  calls, while rollups do not make any server calls whatsoever. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Implementation changes</b>: Rollups do not require any
		  implementation changes, while global report suites require an additional report
		  suite ID be placed in the s_code.js file. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Duplication</b>: Global report suites deduplicate unique visitors,
		  while rollups do not. For example, if a user visits three of your domains in
		  the same day, rollups would count three daily unique visitors. Global report
		  suites would record one unique visitor. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Time frame</b>: Rollups are only processed at midnight each night,
		  while global report suites report data with standard latency. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Breadth</b>: Global report suites can attribute credit to
		  conversion variables between report suites, as well as provide pathing across
		  report suites. Rollups have no way to communicate between report suites. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Historical data</b>: Rollups can aggregate historical data, while
		  global report suites only report data from the point they were implemented. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reports</b>: Global report suites provide additional information on
		  ALL reports implemented; rollups provide aggregate data on only high-level
		  reports. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Supported products</b>: Rollups are not supported in data warehouse
		  or ad hoc analysis. Marketing reports are limited to 40 child report suites. Global
		  report suites can be used across all products, and can have an unlimited number
		  of child report suites.

      <title>Which Report Suite Type Do I Want to Implement?</title>
      <p>When choosing whether to use rollups or global report suites, consider
		  the following: 
		</p>
      <ul id="ul_36F2AB9E01444E75AF14E25CD8F096E0">
        <li id="li_08EE6A4A2D244DBC896EB60201ED6FBF">Is the number of server
			 calls critical to my organization? If keeping server calls limited is
			 important, consider using rollups. Global report suites almost double the
			 number of server calls made. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_D2BE36CB442B4D1DAC43641E5392C8FE">Does reporting a
			 high-level total of traffic across all suites suffice? If deduplicated visitors
			 are a requirement, consider implementing a global report suite. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_C3D0DFF3C10F42109F18A234D8CEEB30">Are pathing and
			 conversion/success events across domains important? If cross-site campaigns are
			 heavily used, consider implementing a global report suite. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_174A4634E2CF49249793E44FF9D34E10">Is viewing total site data
			 time-sensitive? Individual report suites still report near real time. If seeing
			 report suite totals the next day is adequate, rollups are recommended. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_C09386FBCA6748ED9F962C9D8E2B3CBD">Is there a large amount of
			 actionable historical data? Global report suites cannot report retroactively -
			 rollups are recommended if historical data is important. 
		  </li>
        <li id="li_01C3EEAA4C5D43079AD86A07FB2B9FF1">Is data warehouse and
			 ad hoc analysis essential to supplement reporting? If so, a global report suite is
			 recommended. 
		  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Neither choice affects individual report suites. Carefully consider
		  the pros and cons before determining which your organization prefers.
