  <shortdesc>The number of times a specific value is captured, plus the number
	 of page views for which the given value persisted. In other words, Occurrences
	 are sum of page views and page events. Occurrences are available only in ad hoc
	 analysis.

		<p> 
		  <b>Instances</b>: The number of times that a value was set for a
		  variable. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		  <b>Occurrences</b>: The total number of times a value was set or
		  persisted.
		</p>
