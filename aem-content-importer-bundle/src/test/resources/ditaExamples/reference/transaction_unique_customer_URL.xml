  <title>Transaction Unique Customer URL</title>
  <shortdesc>Any process set by the web site owner that begins with an order
	 variable and ends with a success variable. This could mean a product purchase,
	 newsletter sign-up or e-mail request for information after going through a
	 preset process. A unique customer is registered when a person makes a purchase
	 from your site for the first time within a specified period of time. In other
	 words, while one person may buy from your site three times, this person would
	 be recorded as one unique customer. You can tell exactly how many individual
	 people are purchasing from your site.

    <p>There are five different time frames marketing reports use to define unique
		customers: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly. A daily unique
		customer may purchase from your site twice on February 7th, and then again on
		February 8th. This customer registers as two daily unique customers, because
		only the first purchase on the 7th and the purchase on the 8th would count as
		unique purchases for their respective days. This same standard determines
		monthly and yearly unique customers for their respective time frames. It can be
		helpful to ask the following question to see how 
		reports determine who is a unique customer: "How
		many different people purchased from my site during this time period?" 
	 </p>
    <p>The sum of all daily unique customers is not equal to the total monthly
		unique customers for that month. This is because a customer who purchases twice
		in a given month counts as two daily unique customers: one for each day they
		purchased, but only as a single monthly unique customer. The same relationship
		is true for monthly unique customers and yearly unique customers. 
	 </p>
    <p>The method used to give an address to documents and other resources on
		the web. The first part of a URL indicates what protocol to use. The second
		part specifies the IP address or the domain name where the resource is located.
		For example, the first section of 
		<filepath>http://www.adobe.com</filepath> specifies that the web page
		should be fetched using the HTTP protocol. The second section directs the main
		page in the Adobe domain to be retrieved.
