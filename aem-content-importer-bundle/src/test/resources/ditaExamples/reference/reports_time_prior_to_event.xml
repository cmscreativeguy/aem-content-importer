  <title>Time Prior to Event Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Displays the amount of time that passes before a selected
	 conversion event occurs in a visit. You can see the time difference between an
	 image request that starts a visit and an image request that fires the specific
	 conversion event. This report is useful to determine the amount of time people
	 are taking from arriving on your site to hitting a success event, such as a
	 form submission or placing an order.
