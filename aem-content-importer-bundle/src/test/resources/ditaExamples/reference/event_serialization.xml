  <title>Event Serialization</title>
  <shortdesc>Event serialization prevents duplicate events from being reported
	 in analytics. Duplication can commonly occur when a user refreshes a page
	 multiple times, or navigates to a certain page multiple times, or saves the web
	 page to their device. For example, some users save the purchase confirmation
	 page to their device. Every time they view it, orders and revenue would be
	 counted again if event serialization was not in place).
