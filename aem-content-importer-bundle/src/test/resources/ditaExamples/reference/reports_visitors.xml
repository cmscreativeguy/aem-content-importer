  <title>Visitors Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Shows the number of unique visitors to your site for a selected
	 hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year. A unique visitor is counted only one
	 time for the selected time frame. Visitors that return to your site are not
	 counted as unique users again until the time frame has passed.

    <p>The total value displayed at the bottom of the table is the sum all of
		the visits for the specified time period and does not always reflect the number
		of unique visitors. For example, if you run a 
		<wintitle>Daily Unique Visitors Report</wintitle> with a time frame of
		several days, the total can include repeat visitors, because the same visitor
		might return on the next day and be counted again. However, if you run a 
		<wintitle>Monthly Unique Visitors Report</wintitle>, the value in the
		Totals column accurately reflects how many unique visitors came during the
		month.

    <p>
      Marketing reports deduplicate visitors based on the report
		title, independent of the calendar selection. For example, a visitor that
		visits four separate days in a reporting week is counted once in the Weekly
		Unique Visitor Report. In a Daily Unique Visitors Report spanning that week,
		the same visitor is counted four times. Therefore, the total value displayed at
		the bottom of the report table is the sum all of the visits for the specified
		time period and does not always reflect the number of unique visitors.
