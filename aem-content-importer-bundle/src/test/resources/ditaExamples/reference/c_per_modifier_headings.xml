      <wintitle>Per Modifier</wintitle> headings are denoted by adding ~per to
		the classification metric heading. For example, if the 
		<wintitle>Metric</wintitle> heading is 
		<wintitle>Campaigns^~Cost</wintitle>, the PER modifier heading is 
		<wintitle>Campaigns^~Cost~per</wintitle>. Adobe supports the following 
		<wintitle>PER Modifier</wintitle> keywords:

    <p>
      <b>FIXED:</b> Fixed value. Do not perform any scaling. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>DAY:</b> Multiply the value by the number of days in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>ORDER:</b> Multiply the value by the number of orders for the line
		item in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>CHECKOUT:</b> Multiply the value by the number of checkouts for the
		line item in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>UNIT:</b> Multiply the value by the number of units for the line item
		in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>REVENUE:</b> Multiply the value by the revenue amount for the line
		item in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>SCADD:</b> Multiply the value by the number of times the 
		<wintitle>Shopping Cart Add</wintitle> event was called per line item in
		the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>SCREMOVE:</b> Multiply the value by the number of times the 
		<wintitle>Shopping Cart Remove</wintitle> event was called per line item
		in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>INSTANCE:</b> Multiply the value by the number of instances for the
		line item in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLICK:</b> Multiply the value by the number of clicks for the line
		item in the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>EVENT:</b> Multiply the value by the number of times the specified
		custom event occurred per line item of the report. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Example:</b> If Campaign A cost $10,000, the<wintitle>
		  Campaigns^~Cost</wintitle> column contains a value of 10000 and the 
		<wintitle>Campaigns^~Cost~per</wintitle> column contains 
		<wintitle>FIXED</wintitle>. When displaying the Cost for Campaign A in
		the reports, you will see $10,000 as the fixed cost for Campaign A for
		the date range. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Example:</b> If Campaign B that costs approximately $2 per click, the
		
		<wintitle>Campaigns^~Cost</wintitle> column contains 2 and the 
		<uicontrol>Campaigns^~Cost~per</uicontrol> column contains 
		<wintitle>CLICK</wintitle>. When displaying the Cost for Campaign B in
		the reports, Adobe calculates (2 * [number of clicks]) on the fly for the date
		range of the report. This gives you a total cost calculation based on the
		number of clicks performed with Campaign B.
