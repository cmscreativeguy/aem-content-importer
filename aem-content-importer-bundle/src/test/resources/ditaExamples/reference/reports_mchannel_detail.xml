  <title>Marketing Channel Detail - First and Last Touch</title>
  <shortdesc>These reports provide insight on the specific campaigns or
	 keywords are most effective on your site. You can use this report to allocate
	 success metrics and revenue to various channel details, without regard to the
	 overall channel they are in. For example, you can see how a certain Paid Search
	 Keyword is comparing against a certain email campaign. As opposed to the 
	 <wintitle>Marketing Channel Overview Report</wintitle>, this report
	 resembles a standard 
	 marketing report.
