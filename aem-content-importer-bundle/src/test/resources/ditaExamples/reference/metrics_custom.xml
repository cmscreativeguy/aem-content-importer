	 <p>Custom metrics are captured using the 
		<xref
		 href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/?f=events#"
		 format="dita" scope="local">events</xref> variable, and are available as one of
		two types: 
	 </p> 
	 <ul id="ul_595551CABC7E4DBF9067C374C214DF0C"> 
		<li id="li_47D71EE8D8D243BE8652A8FFB5E43E71">Events that count the number
		  of times something occurs. Ad displays, checkouts, and similar events are
		  tracked using this type of event. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_6C16CB95C9F5473DAA620F8B2385C4DC">Events that store values
		  that are often used for additional calculation. These events store numerical
		  values, such as currency, that can be used to perform calculations in your
		  report. For example, you might store the shipping cost for the purchase in a
		  custom event. This lets you compare the amount collected for shipping with the
		  actual cost paid to your shipping provider.
