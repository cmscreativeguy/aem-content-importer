  <title>Conversion Funnel Reports</title>
  <shortdesc>Conversion ratios usually measure conversion between the starting,
	 ending, and milestone events or points of a conversion process. After you code
	 the success events onto your site, the report creates the ratios between
	 these different success events and show them in a 
	 <wintitle>Conversion Funnel Report</wintitle>.

    <p>The following funnel reports available: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_1447B0A48CFB416B9925F247788723D8">
      <li id="li_131FFF9C1DC44C369322F37444CF4D6B">
        <wintitle>Purchase Conversion Funnel</wintitle>: Shows Visits
		  (Report-Specific), Carts, Orders, Units, and Revenue. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_7EC5E5C0785547E685EBEEDF83A0FFAE">
        <wintitle>Cart Conversion
			 Funnel</wintitle>: Displays Visits (Report-Specific), Carts, Checkouts, Orders,
		  and Revenue. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_27783D2106B440CCBA7FA73D4D9CE12C">
        <wintitle>Custom Event
			 Funnel</wintitle>: Displays custom events on your site. It shows custom events
		  1-5 by default. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_769D089958474E709FE511FF471200A3">
        <wintitle>Campaign
			 Conversion Funnel</wintitle>: Shows Click-Throughs, Checkouts, Orders, and
		  Revenue. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This report is also customizable so that you can add Custom Conversion
		Events to the Conversion Funnel to see if visitors to your site make it from
		one step to the next. Success events are good candidates for this type of
		analysis if they almost always occur in a specific order. For example, on a
		retail site, success events generally occur in this order: 
	 </p>
    <p>1. Product Views 
	 </p>
    <p>2. Cart Additions 
	 </p>
    <p>3. Checkouts 
	 </p>
    <p>4. Purchases 
	 </p>
    <p>The report table shows statistics for average sales per click-through,
		and average units sold per click-through. You can add metrics and custom events
		from other reporting groups to these reports. These funnels have many
		similarities but are based on different variables and events. You can use these
		reports to see what percentages and general trends of users fire specific
		events you specify. You can see where users are not following through to
		events, which provides insight to that specific point in the conversion
		process.
