  <title>Classifications</title>
  <shortdesc>Classifications are created by grouping (classifying) granular
	 data from a source report. For example, you might want to analyze display ads,
	 but they are mixed with email, partner, text ad, and social media campaigns.
	 You can create groups so that you can analyze them separately.

    <p> There are three types of classifications for marketing reporting and
		analytics:

    <ul id="ul_61F33F62B1B248049179E945953848F7">
      <li id="li_A819026512C2486EA723FACB7A4CAB0B">
        <b>Campaign classifications</b>: Campaign classifications are defined
		  as elements that will not vary within the campaign, such as campaign name and
		  owner. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_5D19E9898CFD4997AECBB7F02577E2AF">
        <b>Creative elements classification</b>: These vary between placements
		  or instances of the campaign, and include characteristics such as media type,
		  headline, keyword, and media vendor. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_7E99DF4EBA9E4F0BA4F006BC9AD61820">
        <b>Metric-specific classifications</b>: These are fixed numeric values
		  associated with a campaign, such as the hard cost for a campaign. Additionally,
		  you can classify prop and eVar variables. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <note>If you change names of existing classifications in Admin Tools, you
		must update classification rules that use the existing classifications. 
	 </note>
    <p>After you create conversion or traffic classifications, you can import
		classification data through the import tool, or use the Classifications Rule
		Builder.
