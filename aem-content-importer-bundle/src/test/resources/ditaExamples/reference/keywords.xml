  <title>Keywords</title>
  <shortdesc> A word used to perform a search using a search engine. Keywords
	 are the terms typed by a user that trigger your ads to appear. Whether your ads
	 appear when a keyword is used depends on how high you bid on that keyword,
	 compared to other bidders. The more you bid, the more likely your ad is to
	 display when a user searches for that keyword.
