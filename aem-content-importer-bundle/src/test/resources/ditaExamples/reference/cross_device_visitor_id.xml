  <title>Cross-Device Visitor Identification</title>
  <shortdesc>Cross-device visitor identification (also known as 
	 <i>visitor stitching</i>) allows the Marketing Cloud to recognize
	 visitors across browsers and devices, counting them as a single visitor. This
	 feature allows campaigns from one device, such as a mobile device, to receive
	 credit from conversion events made from another device, such as a desktop.

  <conbody>
    <p> This feature works by associating the visitor profiles across each
		device where a user is uniquely identified. After association, the visitor
		profile records are merged and visits from each device are considered to be
		from the same user.
	 </p>
    <p>For example, in the following scenario, the same visitor is counted
		three times:
	 </p>
    <p>a potential customer clicks a link in a marketing email and views your
		site for the first time:
	 </p>
    <p>
      <?xm-replace_text Paragraph?>
    </p>
    <p>Using this type of tracking requires defining the 
		<varname>s.visitorID</varname> variable in your implementation, which can
		be defined using existing elements on your site (such as a login username).
		Cross-device visitor identification can associate each 
		<varname>visitorID</varname> automatically assigned with the custom 
		<varname>visitorID</varname> set. Meaning, the visitor information is
		retained even if the user does not login immediately. 
	 </p>
    <note>This topic is intended for users already familiar with 
		marketing reports and the implementation specific to their
		organization. If you are not familiar with your organization's implementation,
		seek help from a Supported User or the Implementation Guide.

      <title>Connecting Users Across Devices</title>

        <?xm-replace_text Paragraph?>
      </p>
      <p>Cross-device visitor identification uses the visitor ID variable,
		  s.visitorID, to associate a user across devices. When you provide a visitor ID
		  variable with a hit, the system checks for any other visitor profiles that have
		  a matching visitor ID. If one exists, the visitor profile that is already in
		  the system is used from that point forward and the previous visitor profile is
		  no longer used.
		</p>
      <p>The visitor ID is typically set after authentication, or after a
		  visitor performs some other action that enables you to uniquely identify them
		  independently of the device that is used. We recommend creating a hash of the
		  username or an internal ID that does not contain any personally identifiable
		  information.
		</p>
      <p>In the previous example, after the customer signs on from each device,
		  they are all associated with the same user profile. If the visitor later signs
		  out on a device, stitching continues to work since the visitor IDs that are
		  stored in a cookie on each device are already associated with the same visitor
		  profile. We recommend populating the s.visitorID variable whenever possible in
		  case the visitor ID cookie is deleted.
