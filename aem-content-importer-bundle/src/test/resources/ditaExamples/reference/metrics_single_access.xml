  <title>Single Access</title> 
  <shortdesc> 
	 <wintitle>Single Access</wintitle> is defined by the number of visits to
	 your site that contained a single unique 
	 <wintitle>Page Name</wintitle> value. If a user comes to your site and
	 clicks a tracked link, triggers an event (such as a 
	 <wintitle>video view</wintitle>), or reloads the page, the visit is still
	 considered a 
	 <wintitle>Single Access</wintitle> visit. As long as value for the 
	 <wintitle>pageName</wintitle> variable does not change, any number of
	 requests can be sent and the visit is still considered a 
	 <wintitle>Single Access</wintitle>.

				<entry colname="col2">Like traffic, 
				  <wintitle>Single Page Visits</wintitle> is the number of times a
				  single page or value is captured as the only value in a visit. 
				  <p>This metric is equivalent to both 
					 <wintitle>Single Access</wintitle> AND 
					 <wintitle>Bounces</wintitle> in Reports &amp; Analytics,
					 depending on whether<wintitle> Count Repeat Instances</wintitle> is set to Yes
					 or No.
				  </p>
				  <p>This setting also affects pathing reports like Flows, Next
					 Page, Fallout, etc.
