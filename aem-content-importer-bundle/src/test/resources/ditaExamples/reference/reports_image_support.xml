  <title>Image Support Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Groups mobile devices based on the types of images they support.
	 For example, if a visitor's phone that supports 
	 <filepath>.jpg</filepath> images, accesses a site, the Image Support report
	 is incremented by at least one. If the phone supports more than one image
	 format, then a visit to a site might result in multiple increments for that
	 visit. In other words, if your phone supports 
	 <filepath>.jpg</filepath>, 
	 <filepath>.png</filepath>, and 
	 <filepath>.gif</filepath> formats, then each of those groups in the report
	 is incremented. As such, the sum of the groups might be greater than the total
	 shown at the bottom of the report.
