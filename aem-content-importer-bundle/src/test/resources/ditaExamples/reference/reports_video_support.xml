  <title>Video Support Reports</title>
  <shortdesc>Groups mobile devices based on the types of video formats they
	 support. For example, if a visitor's mobile device supports 
	 <filepath>.mp4</filepath>, the Video Support report increments by at least
	 one when it accesses your site. If the phone supports multiple image formats
	 (such as 
	 <filepath>.mp4</filepath> and 
	 <filepath>.wmv</filepath>), each of those groups in the report is
	 incremented. Because of this, the sum of the groups might be greater than the
	 total shown at the bottom of the report.
