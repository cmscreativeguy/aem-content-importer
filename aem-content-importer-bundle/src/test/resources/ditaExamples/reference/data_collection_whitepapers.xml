              <p>Adobe Analytics is the performance and availability leader in
					 the analytics space as measured by Keynote Systems, Inc. Adobe’s unparalleled
					 performance is due in large part to its multi-tiered, fully redundant
					 architecture that encompasses both the network as well as the application. This
					 framework of servers tolerates failures and transparently routes data around
					 trouble spots.
