  <title>Other Uses for Dynamic Variables</title>
  <shortdesc>A primary use for dynamic variables is the capture of HTTP
	 headers, including the values of cookies passed along with them.

    <p>For example: 
	 </p>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop1="D=User-Agent" // captures the user-agent string in
prop1</codeblock>
    <codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.prop25="D=s_vi" // captures the s_vi (visitor ID) cookie value in prop25</codeblock>
    <p>Using dynamic variables in this manner does not cause any parsing of
		header or cookie values. Whatever is present in these fields is what you get in
		your reporting. Any other header can also be captured using the header name
		(for example, 
		<wintitle>Referer</wintitle>, 
		<wintitle>Accept-Language</wintitle>, and so forth). 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <note>Capturing the visitor ID may have limited usefulness in many cases.
		  If you receive more than 500,000 monthly unique visitors, you will exceed the
		  maximum number of unique values allowed for whatever variable you choose to
		  receive this data. 
		</note>
    </p>
    <p>Being able to capture cookied values can be helpful in CNAME
		(first-party cookie) 
		implementations where you have your own
		site cookies to capture for reporting. For example, if you capture a campaign
		ID and store it in a cookie named 
		<codeph>mktg_camp</codeph> using JavaScript, you can then read that
		cookie and set the value of the cookie into eVar1 by putting the following on
		each page: 
		<codeblock outputclass="syntax javascript">s.eVar1="D=mktg_camp"</codeblock></p>
    <p>This causes the campaign ID, found in the 
		<codeph>mktg_camp</codeph> cookie to be passed into 
		reporting on each page.
