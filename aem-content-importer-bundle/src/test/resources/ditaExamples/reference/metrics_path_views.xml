    <p>The term 
		<wintitle>Path View</wintitle> is used to indicate the number of times a
		page was viewed, given the constraints of the displayed path(s). This metric
		reports the number of page views for the given page that occurred within the
		selected path. This metric is available on the 
		<wintitle>Paths</wintitle> report.

		sequence of pages were viewed.
