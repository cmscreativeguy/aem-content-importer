  <title>Allocation</title>
  <shortdesc>Conversion variables (eVars) allow Adobe Analytics to attribute
	 success events to specific variable values. Sometimes, variables encounter more
	 than one value before hitting a success event. For these cases, allocation
	 determines which variable value gets credit for the event.

        <b>Linear</b>: All variable
		  values within the visit of the success event receive equal divided credit. If
		  the success event was a currency amount, the currency is split. If it is a
		  counter event, each conversion variable value receives a fraction of the single
		  instance. These fractions are summed then rounded in reporting.

      <title>Allocation in Ad Hoc Analysis</title>
      <p>Ad Hoc Analysis has the unique ability to report different allocations
		  for conversion variables: the default allocation, last allocation, and linear
		  allocation. If Ad Hoc Analysis is your organization's primary reporting tool,
		  having all conversion variables set to first allocation gives you all available
		  allocation values.
