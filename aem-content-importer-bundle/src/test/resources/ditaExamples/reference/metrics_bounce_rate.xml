	 <p>Bounce rate uses the 
		<xref href="metrics_bounces.xml#concept_2A92D575504E4522B860AB44B0621593"
		 type="concept" format="dita" scope="local">Bounces</xref> metric and is
		calculated as: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<codeph>Bounces divided by Entries</codeph> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Bounce Rate does not include visits where multiple actions occurred on a
		single page. For example, a visit with a video view on a single page is a
		Single Access but not a Bounce. 
		<note>Existing implementations can sometimes contain a calculated metric
		  that differs from the Analytics default metric. Check the calculated metric
		  definition to make sure there are no differences.
