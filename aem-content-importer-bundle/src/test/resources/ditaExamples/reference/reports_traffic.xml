    </ul>
    <p>Some out-of-the-box reports contain both Traffic and Conversion metrics
		(such as the 
		<wintitle>Search Engine</wintitle> reports). However, 
		<wintitle>Traffic</wintitle> and 
		<wintitle>Conversion</wintitle> reports are unique to your organization
		and are displayed in the 
		<uicontrol>Traffic</uicontrol> and 
		<uicontrol>Conversion</uicontrol> menus. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Common Persistence</b>
    </p>
    <p>In Traffic Sources, all report values persist and receive credit until
		they are overwritten or until the visit ends, whichever comes first.
		Previously, only Keywords and Referring Domains persisted. For example, if a
		visitor performs a Google search for 
		<term>DVD</term>, which brings them to your site for a $100 purchase, the
		report allocates $100 credit to the keyword 
		<term>DVD</term> and also to the Google search engine. This functionality
		is unalterable, regardless of admin settings.
