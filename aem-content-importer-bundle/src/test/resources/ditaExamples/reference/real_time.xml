    <p>For real-time reporting, Analytics uses high-frequency metrics and site
		analytics to visually report traffic and page view trending of dynamic news and
		retail web sites. Real-time understands trends in your data from minute to
		minute, within seconds of collection. It collects and streams data to the
		interface, using real-time correlation and tracking of content and some
		conversion.
