  <title>Languages Report</title> 
  <shortdesc>Captures the language setting in the visitor's browser, letting
	 you see the revenue and unique visitors related to the language setting. When
	 you know the effect that preferred languages have on your site's success
	 metrics, you can decide how to present your site in other languages. For
	 example, if you notice that a large number of German-speaking customers
	 generate shopping cart activity on your site, you can translate your site into
	 that language and implement a marketing campaign to drive traffic to your
	 German site.

	 <p>We populate this report based on the accept-language portion of the http
		header request. The language-accept HTTP header is configured as part of each
		browser’s language preference settings:
	 </p>
	 <p><xref
		href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities.en.php"
		format="http"
		scope="external">http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities.en.php</xref>
	 </p>
	 <p>If a browser does not have a language specified, or if the browser
		returns a language ID=0, the report will show "Unspecified" in the graph.
		Browser support for this setting can affect the number of "Unspecified"
		returns. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Some line items in this report include regions. These are region
		subtags.
	 </p>
	 <note>The Hourly time granularity is not supported.
