	 <p>For example, you might see repeat page reloads, which are the number of
		times that pages on your website are reloaded or refreshed during a single
		visit. This option lets you specify whether multiple hits on the same page are
		counted as one, or as multiple page views. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The metric 
		<wintitle>Single Page Visits</wintitle> is equivalent to both 
		<wintitle>Single Access</wintitle> AND 
		<wintitle>Bounces</wintitle> in Reports &amp; Analytics, depending on
		whether<wintitle> Count Repeat Instances</wintitle> is set to Yes or No.
