		  <b>Entry Pages</b> (or sections): Displays, by percentage and by total
		  visits, which pages on your site are the first pages seen by a new visit. You
		  can use this report to identify which of your web pages are the most frequent
		  points of entry, optimize the primary entry points on your site, and drive
		  entry traffic to your key messages. 
		  <p> A useful way to use the Page View metric is to run a 
			 <uicontrol>Paths</uicontrol> &gt; 
			 <uicontrol>Pages</uicontrol> &gt; 
			 <uicontrol>Pages Entry</uicontrol> report, sort by it, and see which
			 entry pages drive the most page views.

		<li id="li_79B1A5DD5CEE45E6957139BD31973DAB"> 
		  <b>Original Entry Pages</b>: Shows the first page viewed for first-time
		  visitors to your site. Each user is counted only once unless they delete their
		  cookies or are not being tracked with cookies. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_7A503C98C05E47B5A697B075D5AF42A5"> 
		  <b>Single Page Visits</b>: Shows pages that are most often both the
		  entry and exit pages for visitor browsing sessions. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_DD156C9F53D541DBB7E6B1918C2E64A9"> 
		  <b> Exit Pages</b>: Displays, by percentage and by total visits, the
		  pages on your site that were the last pages visitors viewed before leaving your
		  site. Exit pages have a visit breakdown scope, meaning they persist across all
		  hits for a visit.

	 <ul id="ul_2D321F05FBB7416D90437E2F05DC423B"> 
		<li id="li_2DF0CC043C9343D99F77B2152B463A45"><b>Entries</b>: same as
		  instances or occurrences, how many times the specified page is the entry page
		  for a visit. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_DA6ED870D72B4C919BA7C178B7C921FC"><b>Visits</b>: how many
		  visits was this page the entry page, this metric should equal entries. 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_BAAB86DBF4E646A69A0B1C1F04180534"><b>Exits</b>: Number of
		  times an Exit occurred where the Entry page was the one specified. If you want
		  to see the number of times the entry page was also the exit page, use the
		  Bounces metric instead of exits. 
		</li> 
	 </ul> 
	 <p> 
		<b>Segmentation in an Entry Pages Report</b> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Running an 
		<wintitle>Entry Pages Report</wintitle> only reports on entry pages, even
		if you apply segment to a non-entry page. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> For example, assume a visit sequence is as follows: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
		<filepath>Page A</filepath> &gt; 
		<filepath>Page B</filepath> &gt; 
		<filepath>Page C</filepath> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>If Page B and Page C are used in a segment, only Page A is reported in
		an 
		<wintitle>Entry Pages Report</wintitle>, because Page A is the entry
		page.
