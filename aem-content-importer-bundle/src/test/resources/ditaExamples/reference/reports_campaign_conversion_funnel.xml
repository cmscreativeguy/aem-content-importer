		<uicontrol>Campaign Conversion Funnel</uicontrol></p>
    <p> The top of a funnel graphic displays conversion data. The bottom
		displays statistics for all events in the top area, based on Orders and up to
		two other metrics, Revenue and Units. 
	 </p>
    <p>Keep in mind the following information when interpreting conversion
		funnel data: 
	 <ul id="ul_1960D68A3F364F489C84902AD0F073E2"><li id="li_CBF36287749E4E39A14926C64E6F384F"><p>Statistics for current time periods might not be completed when you
			 view data, which can affect trends from a previous day to the current one. 
		  </p></li><li id="li_5E12B8E3AC0C4E0E86D11ED477443F8A"><p>When no filter is applied to the funnel, the Visits metric
			 represents conversion visits, or visits during which the campaign variable, any
			 eVar variable, or a success event was fired. Visits during which none of these
			 properties were passed into reports are not included in this total. 
		  </p></li><li id="li_6FA5119B0E7C4BF0B645301A15AD0C2A"><p>When a filter is applied to the funnel, the Visits metric represents
			 instances (or click-throughs). This value is the total number of times that the
			 given variable was populated by users on your site, excluding those instances
			 that do not meet the filter requirements. A single visit can involve multiple
			 instances. 
		  </p></li><li id="li_D23AEA1A11E14D7C9497F9890CED7A12"><p>It is possible for deeper levels on the funnel to report higher
			 numbers than shallower levels. For example, you might see more orders than
			 click-throughs, or more checkouts than product views. There are a number of
			 reasons why this situation occurs: 
		  </p><ul id="ul_489535FAE5FF4D15852F6B83EC3D43C5"><li id="li_F8F639F2D13A47B79890DFD248259081"><p>You have more orders than click-throughs if the Tracking Code
				  variable is set to a long cookie expiration (for example, a month), and users
				  perform only one click-through but return several times and place orders during
				  the period, before the Tracking Code value expires. 
				</p></li><li id="li_7DC0A1F44A11472BA788D41B1A3119F3"><p>You have more checkouts than product views if the user is able
				  to skip the product view page (as in the case of an upsell page), or if the
				  user is able to save his shopping cart and return later to complete the order.
				  If the product view occurs before the date range selected and the checkout
				  occurs afterwards, you will see one checkout and zero product views. If you
				  notice such a discrepancy, it does not indicate a problem with reporting or
				  even an implementation error. Rather, you can use this data to understand how
				  users are interacting with your site, even if it does not fit the funnel in the
				  way that you expect.
