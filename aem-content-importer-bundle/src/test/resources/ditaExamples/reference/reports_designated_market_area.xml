  <title>Designated Market Area Report</title>
  <shortdesc>DMA. 
	 Segregates the United States
	 into marketing areas. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in each market area
	 supply the American Registry of Internet Names (ARIN) with the IP addresses
	 they use. Adobe partners with Digital Envoy to receive geo- segmentation data
	 that matches the IP address a website visitor uses with the geographic city,
	 state, zip code, and DMA for that IP address.
