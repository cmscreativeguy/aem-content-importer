  <title>Ranked Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Displays a table with ranked items, using numbers and percentages
	 in metrics. For example, a Pages Report ranks the pages on your site based on
	 traffic, and the detail table shows percentages and numbers for metrics like
	 Page Views and Revenue. A horizontal bar chart is the default graph type.
	 Graphs display a color for each metric. Ranked reports can display multiple
	 metrics in a report.
