      <p>If you change an event from counter, numeric, or currency to another
		  type, any data captured as the previous type is hidden until the type is
		  changed back. Version 14 event data is displayed only when the current event
		  type matches the captured event type. 
		</p>
      <p> Any data sent while the event is set to another type is lost
		  permanently.

      <title>Version 15 Report Suites with Historical Version 14 Data</title>
      <p>In version 15, you can change an event from counter, numeric, or
		  currency to another type without losing access to previously captured data.
		  However, if you change an event type, any historical version 14 data that was
		  captured as the previous type is hidden until the type is changed back. 
		</p>
      <p>For these report suites, do not change an event type unless you
		  understand that you will lose access to historical version 14 data for that
		  event. The historical version 14 event data is displayed only when the current
		  event type matches the captured event type.
