  <title>Event Serialization</title>
  <shortdesc>The process of implementing measures to prevent duplicate events
	 from entering Analytics reporting. Duplicate events can occur when a user
	 refreshes a page multiple times, navigates to a certain page multiple times, or
	 saves the web page to their machine (i.e. some users may save the purchase
	 confirmation page to their computer). Every time they viewed the page, orders
	 and revenue would be counted again if event serialization was not in place.
