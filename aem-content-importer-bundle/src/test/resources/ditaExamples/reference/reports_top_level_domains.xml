    <p> The originating domain refers to the domain through which the user is
		browsing the web (meaning, the ISP), rather than the referring domain that
		brought the user to your site. Domains ending in Commercial (.com), Network
		(.net), Education (.edu), Government (.gov) and Organization (.org) are usually
		based in the United States, and are listed separately from the rest of the
		countries. 
	 </p>
    <p>All other countries have specific domain extensions, such as Brazil
		(.br) and the United Kingdom (.gb). 
		Marketing reports recognize all country extensions. You
		can use this report to help you to tailor content on your site to people from
		the countries that generate the majority of your revenue and to decide if you
		need to create different instances of your entire site.
