  <shortdesc>You can eliminate data from internal website activities, such as
	 site testing and employee usage, from your marketing reports. Excluding data
	 improves report accuracy by excluding IP address data. Additionally, you can
	 remove data from denial of service or other malicious events that can skew
	 report data. You can configure exclusion or by using your firewall.

		<title>Exclude by IP Address</title> 
		<p>An IP address is an Internet address. All Internet users are assigned
		  numerical IP addresses (typically through Internet service providers) that
		  effectively act as electronic identifiers. 
		</p> 
		<p>Page views are counted and unique page visitors are identified through
		  IP addresses. By excluding IP addresses from being counted, you can prevent
		  Adobe from tracking frequent visitors. This feature can allow you and your
		  colleagues to visit your site without skewing your traffic data. You may
		  exclude up to 50 different IP addresses. 
		</p> 
		<p>You can use wildcard indicators (*) to exclude a range of addresses.
		  For example, 
		  <filepath>0.0.*.0</filepath> would exclude all IP addresses between 
		  <filepath>0.0.0.0</filepath> and 
		  <filepath>0.0.255.0</filepath>. You may exclude up to 50 different IP
		  addresses.

		<title>Impact of IP Obfuscation</title>
		<p> If IP obfuscation is enabled, IP exclusion happens before the IP
		  address is obfuscated, so customers don’t need to change anything when they
		  enable IP obfuscation.
		</p>
		<p>If the last octet is removed, that is done before IP filtering. As
		  such, the last octet is replaced with a 0, and IP exclusion rules should be
		  updated to match IP addresses with a zero on the end. Matching * should match
		  0.
