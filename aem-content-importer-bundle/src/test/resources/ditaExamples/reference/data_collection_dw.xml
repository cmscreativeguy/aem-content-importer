    <p>
      Data warehouse requests use the following data
		collection process: 
	 </p>
    <ol id="ol_EB61FCA4BB4948A896AA6237D0240E70">
      <li id="li_0694519AA3B24B16A9D945528238849F">An image request is sent to
		  Adobe data collection servers. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_686E9642CDBB470DAB92E1605E54EB84">A server call is returned to
		  acknowledge the server call. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_018294A486874A73905EBF8D097BDA94">Collection servers submit
		  the data to a cache file. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_63A73C27242A4F77BA5E5F2019F47C8F">Adobe determines whether 
		  Data warehouse is enabled for the report suite. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_146194C623C0465EA848CB799EA5E1EA">If enabled, the data is sent
		  to a container to be stored for a period as defined in your contract. 
		  <p>When the data is stored, you can use 
			 data warehouse and segment interface to create
			 reports on the stored data. 
		  </p></li>
      <li id="li_06F548E4187F4F40AA4D52E81C61E08E">The data is submitted to
		  processing, first processing VISTA rules and GeoSegmentation location. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_2E3C434CC9F946358941CD3BBDAC8869">The data is submitted to
		  tables for viewing in 
		  reports. 
		</li>
    </ol>
    <p> If 
		data warehouse is enabled, data is duplicated and sent
		to both the processed data tables and to the data storage unit for the report
		suite. You can enable 
		data warehouse only for data storage purposes.
		Frequently, 
		users enable 
		data warehouse to create advanced data relationship
		reports through the 
		reporting interface. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, you run a company that sells computers, and you want to see
		the number of visitors to a certain page and who also purchased a certain
		printer. The 
		data warehouse interface can access the raw data from
		the data storage container and create a post-analysis data report, which 
		Adobe sends to a selected email address.
