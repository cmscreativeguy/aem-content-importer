  <title>Pending Actions</title> 
  <shortdesc>The Manage Pending Actions page lets you view a list of pending
	 actions in your Analytics environment. A pending action is any system change
	 that requires approval from Adobe before implementation.

	 <p>Pending Actions displays requests that are not immediately applied to
		your report suites. These requests typically require additional action from
		Adobe. For example, a request for a 20-item correlation or a large increase in
		traffic might require additional hardware. Assigning these requests a status of
		pending lets Adobe prepare for the requested change to prevent disruption to
		your data collection process.
