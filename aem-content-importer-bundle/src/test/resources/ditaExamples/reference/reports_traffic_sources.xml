                <p> Shows the domains that referred the customers that most
						impacted your site’s success metrics. Referrers fall into two main categories:
						Domains and URLs. Domains refer to the domain name, and appear as the base
						domain without the query string or subdirectories attached. URLs include the
						base domain name, as well as any query strings or subdirectories.

                <p> Displays the original referrers that produced the customers
						on your site. Customers can visit your site multiple times, and have a
						different referrer for each visit.
					 </p>
                <p>This report is useful to see how visitors were referred the
						first time they arrived at your site. This can help you see if they continued
						to use the same referrer, and view patterns in how customers are referred to
						your site. You can view the number of visitors generated by an original
						referrer or discover how much revenue each original referrer was responsible
						for producing. 
						<wintitle>Referrer</wintitle> reports can be populated each
						time a visitor comes to your site, even if the visitor comes to the site
						multiple times during a session (before the visit expires.)

				  </entry>
              <entry colname="col2">
                <p> Displays the domain or URL where your visitors came from
						before they arrived at your site, the methods visitors use to find your
						website, and the number of visits to your site that came from these referring
						locations. 
					 </p>
                <p>For example, if a visitor clicks a link from Site A and
						arrives at your site, Site A is the referrer if it is not defined as part of
						your domain. During implementation, your implementation consultant can help you
						to define the domains and URLs that are part of your website (this can also be
						done after implementation.) Any domains or URLs that are not part of those
						defined domains and URLs are considered referrers. 
					 </p>
                <p>For example, if web page A and web page B are added to the
						internal URL filter, but web page C is not, then web page C is considered a
						referrer. 
					 </p>
                <p>See 
						<xref href="internal_URL_filter_admin.xml#concept_D6BB8358DB7643F0B13E5DC9B7607998" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Internal URL Filters?></xref></p>
                <note>Analytics records a referring domain as an email when
						visitors click an emailed message link containing the protocol 
						<codeph>imap://</codeph> or 
						<filepath>mail://</filepath> and arrive at your site. 
					 </note>
                <p>For example, anything coming from 
						<codeph>http://mail.yahoo.com</codeph> is not counted as an
						email referrer because the protocol is 
						<filepath>http://</filepath>. Emails from Outlook are
						reported in the 
						<wintitle>Typed/ Bookmarked</wintitle> line. Any referrer
						with an HTTP protocol where the domain is a known search engine is reported in
						the 
						<wintitle>Search Engine</wintitle> line.
