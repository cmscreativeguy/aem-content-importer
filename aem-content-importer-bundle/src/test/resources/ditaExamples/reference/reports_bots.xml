  <title>Bots Report</title>
  <shortdesc>Displays which spiders and bots have visited your site during a
	 given time period. Traffic that is identified as being generated by a bot
	 (based on bot rules you set up) is not sent to your report suite. Rather, it is
	 collected separately. The report displays the pages that these
	 agents have visited.
