  <conbody> 
	 <p>Instances are counted for all hit types, but are not counted when a
		value is recorded for a variable on a subsequent hit due to persistence. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>For example, if a user arrives on your site via 
		<filepath>example.com</filepath>, the first image request on your site
		contains the referrer of 
		<filepath>example.com</filepath>. When this value is set, one Instance is
		attributed to 
		<filepath>example.com</filepath> even though this referrer is recorded
		for all pages viewed during that visit. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Instances for conversion variables in data warehouse were added
		mid-2011, allowing data warehouse requests to treat a specific conversion
		variable instance as a metric. These metrics are not available for reporting
		prior to the time they were introduced.
