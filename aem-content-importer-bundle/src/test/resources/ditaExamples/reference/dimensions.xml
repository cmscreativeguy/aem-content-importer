        Ad Hoc Analysis
      </title>
      <p>When performing ad hoc analysis, you can base reports on any dimension
		  item. You can break down dimensions by other dimensions to analyse and compare
		  nearly anything. For example, you can view trends across other continuous
		  dimensions like Page Depth. Then you could visualize a metric like Revenue
		  Participation to see how revenue is influenced as a visitor travels deeper into
		  your site. 
		</p>
      <p>In the 
		  <wintitle>Dimensions</wintitle> pane, you can search for dimensions and
		  drag them to the 
		  <wintitle>Table Builder</wintitle> or the report table. You can sort
		  them based on the following categories:

        Data Workbench
      </title>
      <p>In 
		  the data workbench, dimensions are set of elements, all of
		  which are of a similar type from the user's perspective. The elements define a
		  set of categories into which data can be grouped. For example, the elements
		  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday make up a
		  Weekday dimension. 
		</p>
      <p>The following dimension types exist: 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Countable</b>: A dimension type in which the number of elements in
		  the dimension can be counted by the system. Countable dimensions must be
		  derived from other Countable dimensions. Countable dimensions can be parents of
		  other dimensions or children of other countable dimensions. 
		</p>
      <p>Examples: Visitor, Session, Page View, Booking, and Order. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Simple</b>: A dimension that has a one-to-many relationship with a
		  parent countable dimension. A simple dimension can be thought of as
		  representing a property of elements of its parent dimension. 
		</p>
      <p>Example: Visitor Referrer is a simple dimension with a parent of the
		  Visitor dimension. Each Visitor can have only one Visitor Referrer (their first
		  HTTP referrer), but many Visitors might have the same Visitor Referrer.
		  Therefore the Visitor Referrer is one-to-many with the Visitor dimension. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Numeric</b>: A dimension that has ordered, numerical values and a
		  one-to-many relationship with a parent countable dimension. A numeric dimension
		  can be thought of as representing a numeric property of elements of its parent
		  dimension. Numeric dimensions are often used to define sum metrics. 
		</p>
      <p>Example: The numeric dimension Session Revenue defines the revenue, in
		  dollars, for each Session. Each Session has a single amount of revenue, but any
		  number of Sessions might have the same revenue, so Session Revenue is
		  one-to-many with Session. A metric revenue might be defined as 
		  <filepath>sum(Session_Revenue</filepath>, 
		  <filepath>Session</filepath>), giving the total amount of revenue for
		  the selected Sessions. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Many-to-Many</b>: A dimension that has a many-to-many relationship
		  with a parent countable dimension. A many-to-many dimension can be thought of
		  as representing a set of values for each element of its parent dimension. A
		  many-to-many dimension is equivalent to an (anonymous) countable dimension with
		  its parent and a Simple dimension with a parent of the anonymous countable
		  dimension. 
		</p>
      <p>Example: The many-to-many dimension Search Phrase has a parent of
		  Session. Each Session can use zero or more Search Phrases, and a Search Phrase
		  can be used in any number of Sessions. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Denormal</b>: A dimension that has a one-to-one relationship with a
		  parent Countable dimension. The element names of the denormal dimension can
		  carry information about the corresponding elements of the parent dimension. A
		  denormal dimension can be thought of as storing an arbitrary string value for
		  each element of the parent. Denormal dimensions can be used with the data workbench
		  server's segment export capability to output details about a subset or
		  segment of a countable dimension. In addition, denormal dimensions can be
		  referenced in metric formulas and worksheet visualizations and can be used
		  (with certain restrictions) to define filters. 
		</p>
      <p>Example: The denormal dimension EMail Address has a parent of Visitor.
		  Each Visitor has an EMail Address, and each element of the EMail Address
		  dimension is associated with a single Visitor. Even if two visitors have the
		  same e-mail address, their addresses will be different elements of the EMail
		  Address dimension. A Segment Export can reference the EMail Address dimension
		  to output the EMail Address of each visitor in a Segment. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Time</b>: A dimension that enables you to create a set of periodic
		  or absolute local time dimensions (such as Day, Day of Week, Hour, Hour of Day,
		  and so on) based on a timestamp field that you specify. When defining time
		  dimensions, you also can choose a day other than Monday to be used as the start
		  of a week by specifying the Week Start Day parameter. 
		</p>
      <p>Example: The time dimension Session Time has parent of Session.
		  Therefore, the dimension defines a set of time dimensions (Day, Day of Week,
		  Hour, Hour of Day, Month, and Week) whose elements correspond to the times at
		  which visitors' sessions on the site began. 
		</p>
      <p>
        <b>Derived</b>: Derived dimensions, rather than being defined in the
		  dataset configuration based on the data being processed, are defined in the
		  profile based on other dimensions or metrics. Many derived dimensions are
		  created automatically to drive different types of visualizations. For example,
		  when a user builds a site or process map, the data workbench server silently creates a
		  Prefix dimension. Others, such as the reporting time dimensions, are defined
		  by files in the Dimensions directory of a profile.
