  <title>Classification Hierarchies</title>
  <shortdesc>The 
	 <wintitle>Classification Hierarchies</wintitle> page lets you define
	 classification hierarchies that you can use to create 
	 <wintitle>Hierarchy</wintitle> reports with the same name.

  <conbody>
    <p>A 
		<wintitle>Hierarchy</wintitle> report lets you drill down into
		increasingly refined data sets, based on the classification hierarchy, so you
		can more easily view data relationships. 
	 </p>
    <p>You can build classification hierarchies for web pages, campaigns,
		products, or any other 
		report variable. The Hierarchy report displays
		units, orders, and revenue for each of the variable classifications in the
		hierarchy. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, if a Product hierarchy includes Apparel &gt; Men's Clothing
		&gt; Shirts &gt; Polo Shirts &gt; XL Polo Shirts, the Hierarchy report displays
		sales data for the Apparel classification. You can then drill down to see data
		about Men's Clothing, Shirts, Polo Shirts, and XL Polo Shirts. Classification
		hierarchies let you quickly identify how each classification in the hierarchy
		contributes to Apparel performance.

    <p>Create the classifications before adding them to a hierarchy.
