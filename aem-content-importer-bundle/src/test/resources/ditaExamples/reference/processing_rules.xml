		<title>Get Authorized to Use Processing Rules</title>
		<p>All users (including administrators) must be granted authorization to
		  use processing rules by Adobe. The authorization process is described in 
		  <xref
			href="http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/kb/en_US/analytics/kb/processing-rules-authorization.html"
			format="http" scope="external">Become authorized to use Processing
			 Rules</xref>.
		</p>
		<p>We recommend that a limited group of administrators (usually 2-3) have
		  access to processing rules, so that all requested changes are centrally
		  managed. It’s best to have more than one processing rules user so there is a
		  backup user in case urgent changes need to be made while one administrator is
		  unavailable. Because processing rules permanently affect Analytics data, we
		  strongly recommend that processing rules users be well trained in Adobe
		  Analytics, and be familiar with all sources of data for your report suites
		  (standard web sites, mobile sites, mobile apps, Data Insertion API, and so on).
		  Knowledge of the context data variables and standard variables populated in
		  various platforms will help prevent accidental deletion or alteration of data.

		<title>Use Context Data to Simplify Data Collection</title> 
		<p>Context data variables are a new type of variable that are available
		  only to processing rules. To use context data variables, key/value data pairs
		  are sent in by your implementation, and processing rules are used to capture
		  these values in standard Analytics variables. This frees programmers from
		  understanding exactly which prop and/or eVar should contain which value.

		<title>Use Processing Rules to Transform Hit Data and Trigger
		  Events</title> 
		<p>Processing rules can monitor incoming values to transform common typos
		  and set events based on reported data. Props can be copied to eVars. Values can
		  be concatenated for reports, and events can be set.
