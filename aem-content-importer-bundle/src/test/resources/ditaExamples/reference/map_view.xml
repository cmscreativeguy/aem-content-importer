  <title>Map View</title>

	 Ranked report types. The Map view color codes countries according to their
	 relative contribution to your highest-value line item.

    <p>The legend, visible to the right of the Map view, specifies ranges which
		are calculated in increments of 5th's of your top line item (first 1/5th,
		second 1/5th, etc). The darker the color, the greater the number of daily
		unique visitors from that country that are visiting your site.
	 </p>
    <p>Only one metric is used when you are in the Map view (more are available
		in the ranked/trended view).
