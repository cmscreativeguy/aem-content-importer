                <p>The number of possibilities for using the Custom Event
						Report is practically infinite. Since each marketing report is a little
						different, this report is used differently for each client. However, just to
						give a simple example of a common use, the Custom Event Report can be used as a
						counter that shows the number of times an event occurs. For example, if event1
						is set to count the number of times a document is downloaded, then the Custom
						Event Report will show the total number of times the event (or download)
						occurs.

                <p>The Video Views Report is used to show the number of times a
						video is viewed per time period. A single video view represents a single video
						being watched by a visitor and may consist of multiple plays, stops, pauses,
						and starts, but always consists of a visitor viewing some portion of the video.

                <p>The Video Visits Report shows the number of visits that
						contained a video view over a time period. When visitors view multiple videos
						on a single visit, one video visit is counted. For example, let's say you are
						tracking video views per day, and a visitor views two videos on Monday - only
						one visit will be counted for viewing the videos. However, if the visitor
						returns again on Tuesday, they will be counted again no matter how many videos
						watched.

                <p> The Daily Unique Video Visitors Report shows the number of

                <p>The Videos Report lists videos and metrics associated with
						them during the time period selected. It also reports on milestone events, such
						as the number of views that were longer than 75%, for example. Conversion
						metrics such as Revenue and Custom Events may be attributed to videos that
						preceded the conversion event but were not actually viewed during the time
						period selected. For example, if a video is viewed in November and a purchase
						occurs in December, the video may receive credit for the December purchase.
						Using breakdowns, this report allows you to see the relationship between video
						views and other conversion and acquisition reports such as campaigns.

						cookies. If the mobile device listed in the user agent string is also listed in
						Adobe's list of mobile devices, then the Supported line item in the Cookie
						Support report will be incremented by one. Otherwise, the Not Supported line
						item in the report will be incremented by one.

						one image format, then a visit to a site may result in multiple increments for

						fragments, querying for ones that begin with a certain page, end with a certain

                <p>This report identifies the depth at which each page within

						pages viewed before that page. So, if your "About Us" page is the third page
						visited by a given visitor, its depth for that visit is three. You can use this
						report to identify which pages compel your visitors to travel the deepest into
						your site and to optimize content and navigation to make key content more
						accessible.

						each reporting group and "standard" conversion metrics (revenue, orders, etc.).
						The Overview section gives a visual summary of this conversion data. The Funnel
						Section shows statistics for all events in the Overview section based on Orders
						and up to two other metrics: Revenue and Units. You can add metrics and custom
						events from other reporting groups to these reports by clicking the Selected
						Events option in the Report Status and Navigation header.

						purchase from your site multiple times during a day, the Daily Unique Customers
						report records that person as one "unique visitor" so you can tell exactly how
						many individual people are coming to your site during the day. A daily unique
