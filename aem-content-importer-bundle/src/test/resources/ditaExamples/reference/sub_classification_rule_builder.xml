  <title>Sub-Classifications and the Rule Builder - Use Case</title>
  <shortdesc> You can combine the Classification Rule Builder with
	 sub-classifications to simplify classification management and reduce the number
	 of rules required. You might want to do this if your tracking code consists of
	 codes that you would like to classify separately.

		<xref href="c_sub-classifications.xml#concept_19EE5513A7DC43C38CC396E96F306CFE" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Sub-Classifications?></xref> for
		conceptual information about sub-classifications.

    <p>
      <b>Example</b>
    </p>
    <p> Assume the following tracking code: 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <codeph>channel:broad_campaign:creative</codeph>
    </p>
    <p> A classification hierarchy allows you to apply a classification to a
		classification (called 
		<term>sub-classification</term>). Meaning, you can use the importer like
		a relational database, with multiple tables. One table maps full tracking codes
		to keys, and another maps those keys to other tables.

        <?xm-replace_text Paragraph?>
      </image>
    </p>
    <p> After you have this structure in place, you can use the 
		<xref href="classification_rule_builder.xml#concept_C1F219E622044D43852EF5168FF7192A" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Classifications Rule Builder?></xref>
		to upload small files that only update the lookup tables (the green and red
		tables in the preceding image). Then, you can use the rule builder to keep the
		main classification table up-to-date. 
	 </p>
    <p>The following task describes how to accomplish this.
