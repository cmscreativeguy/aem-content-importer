  <title>Click-throughs</title> 
  <shortdesc>Click-throughs represent the number of times that a tracking code
	 for a given campaign was passed into reporting. When a visitor clicks on an
	 affiliate link that has been tagged with one of these tracking codes, the
	 visitor is taken to your landing page and the tracking code is captured in 
	 <varname>s.campaign</varname>. That data is sent into reporting and a
	 click-through is recorded.
