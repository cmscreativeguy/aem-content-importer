    <p>Anomaly Detection is a feature within Reports &amp; Analytics that
		allows you to separate "true signals" from "noise" and then identify potential
		factors that contributed to those signals or anomalies. In other words, it lets
		you identify which statistical fluctuations matter and which don't. You can
		then identify the root cause of a true anomaly. Furthermore, you can get
		reliable metric (KPI) forecasts.

    <p>Examples of anomalies you might investigate include:

    <p>Anomaly Detection uses a training period to calculate, learn, and report
		prediction interval data per day. The training period is the historical period
		that identifies what is normal vs. anomalous, and applies what is learned to
		the reporting period. Depending on your configuration, the training period
		consists of the previous 30, 60, or 90 days before the start of the view or
		reporting period. 
	 </p>
    <p>To calculate the data, the daily total for each metric is compared with
		the training period using each of the following algorithms: 
	 </p>
    <p>· Holt Winters Multiplicative (Triple Exponential Smoothing) 
	 </p>
    <p>· Holt Winters Additive (Triple Exponential Smoothing) 
	 </p>
    <p>· Holts Trend Corrected (Double Exponential Smoothing) 
	 </p>
    <p>Each algorithm is applied to determine the algorithm with the smallest
		Sum of Squared Errors (SSE). The Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) and the
		current Standard Error are then calculated to make sure that the model is
		statistically valid. 
	 </p>
    <p>These algorithms can be extended to provide predictive forecasts of
		metrics in future periods. 
	 </p>
    <p>Because the training period varies based on the start of the view
		(reporting) period, you might see differences in the data reported for the same
		date as part of two different time periods. 
	 </p>
    <p>For example, if you run a report for January 1-14, and then run a report
		for January 7-21, you might see different prediction data for the same metric
		between January 7-14 in the two different reports. This is a result of the
		difference in training periods.
