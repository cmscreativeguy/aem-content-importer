  <title>Fallout Report</title>
  <shortdesc>The Fallout Report shows where visitors leave (fallout) and
	 continue through (fallthrough) a pre-specified sequence of pages. It displays
	 conversion and fallout rates between each step. For example, you can track a
	 visitor's fallout points during a buying process. You select a beginning point
	 and a conclusion point, and add intermediate points to create a website
	 navigation path.
