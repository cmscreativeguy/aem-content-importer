  <conbody>
    <p>When a visitor uses a mobile device to access your site, the Net
		Protocols report increments by at least one. If the phone supports multiple
		network protocols then each of those groups in the report increments. Because
		of this, the sum of the groups might be greater than the total shown at the
		bottom of the report.
