      <b>Next Flow</b>
    </p>
    <p>The Next Flow report group has three reports: Next Page Flow, Next
		Section Flow, and Next Server Flow. The reports in this group show you the most
		common pages, site sections, and servers that a visitor accessed after
		accessing the page, site section, or server you specify. These reports show you
		the most common paths taken through your website. 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Previous Flow</b>
    </p>
    <p> Previous Flow reports are similar to Next Flow reports, except rather
		than seeing where visitors when after a selected peg, you see where visitors
		were before visiting a specified page. The controls for using the report are
		identical to the controls for the Next Flow reports.
