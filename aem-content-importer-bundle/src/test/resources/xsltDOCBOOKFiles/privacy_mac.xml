	 <p>Customer Record Management (CRM) databases often contain PII. The
		definition of PII varies from region to region. Generally, PII means
		identifiable information about an individual consumer that is collected online
		by the operator from that individual. PII data is maintained by the operator in
		an accessible form, including attributes like: such as first and last name, a
		home or other physical address, an email address, a telephone number, a social
		security number, or any other identifier that permits the physical or online
		contacting of a specific individual.

	 <p>Adobe provides tools that allow advertisers to collect behavioral
		information about consumers that visit their sites or use their applications.
		Adobe also provides tools allow advertisers to enhance this information with
		offline or external customer records that the advertiser may have within other
		information management systems. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>One common reason advertisers do this is to improve the information
		available when making consumer-appropriate marketing and advertising decisions.
		Adobe Analytics allows its advertisers to upload personally identifiable
		information (PII) such as email addresses. When uploading PII to Adobe
		Analytics, Adobe recommends that the customer should hash PII prior to
		uploading it to Adobe. Hashed information can still be used for analysis and
		for marketing purposes. As a reminder, Adobe prohibits advertisers from sending
		sensitive personal information to Adobe Analytics, such as medical records,
		financial account information, and information about minors. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Adobe realizes that these types of marketing and advertising decisions
		may have consumer privacy implications, which is why Adobe has built in privacy
		controls to help advertisers meet their consumers' expectations. Adobe
		recommends its advertisers carefully consider which information is appropriate
		to use for marketing purposes and in which circumstances the advertiser has
		permission to use such information. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><b>Best Practices</b>

	 <p> Adobe recommends its advertisers carefully consider which information
		is appropriate to use for marketing purposes and in which circumstances the
		advertiser has permission to use such information. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> As consumer privacy law remains in flux, Adobe recommends that
		advertisers respect three common tenets: 
	 </p> 
	 <ol id="ol_BC06F01F1C174495B1C8B311949754F2"> 
		<li id="li_4CA3A0DD9404454F8941391CC2169A8E">Do what you say (in your
		  privacy policy). 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_92AC8D53C14E4590BBCE2C85DCD76379">Say what you do (in your
		  privacy policy). 
		</li> 
		<li id="li_92C3639F38374E099075CBCA8C974FC9">Do not surprise your
		  consumers. 
		</li> 
	 </ol> 
	 <p> With these expectations in mind, Adobe recommends that when an
		advertiser associates browsing activities to PII, the advertiser provides
		notices or personalization indicating that the consumer is authenticated. An
		example of this is including a greeting within the header of the website. Adobe
		also recommends that advertisers describe in its privacy policy what type of
		browsing information it associates with PII and under what circumstances
		browsing information is associated with PII. Lastly, Adobe strongly recommends
		advertisers review the opt-out choices they provide their consumers to
		understand whether and how they can use unauthenticated profile information
		post opt out.

		<p><b>Vinay Geol</b> should help craft privacy regarding how all MAC uses
		  privacy/cookies. Privacy implications around each part of the workflow. Moving
		  from CRM to MAC. Can it include PII? What is PII? What isn't PII?

		<p>CRM data is Known Data or Info. Going to combine with activity that

		<p>Refactoring of implementation docs as it relates to privacy and
		  cookies.

		<p>Add content to
		  https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/t_publish_audience_segment.html,
		  as follows: 
		</p> 
		<p> Audiences are not filtered based on the authentication state of a
		  visitor. If a visitor can browse your site in un-authenticated and
		  authenticated states, actions that occur when a visitor is un-authenticated can
		  still cause a visitor to be included in an audience. Please review &lt;link&gt;
		  to understand the full privacy implications of audience sharing.

		<p> - With these expectations in mind, Adobe recommends that when an

		  what type of browsing information it associates with PII and under what
