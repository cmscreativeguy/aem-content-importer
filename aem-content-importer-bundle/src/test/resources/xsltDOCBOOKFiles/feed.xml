    <p>The Feed might be empty the first time you log in to the Marketing
		Cloud. As you create 
		<xref href="boards.xml#concept_52E7E7B015D14E2C852D9618CF76860F" format="dita" scope="local">boards</xref> and 
		<xref href="cards.xml#concept_0A2472B530E04930BCE5CC23A8BEF9E0" format="dita" scope="local">cards</xref>, and other users share content with
		you, the Feed will automatically populate to help you and your team members
		keep up to date.

    </p>
    <p>Cards in the Feed are ordered from newest to oldest. Newly created cards
		automatically display in the top left corner of the Feed. Additionally, cards
		with new annotations from you or other users are moved to the top left corner
		to make them more prominent. You cannot manually re-order cards in the Feed. 
	 </p>
    <p>In the feed, you can monitor the latest changes in your assets and
		campaign's performance at a glance, and navigate to a more detailed information
		of each individual card.
