    <p>If you leverage real-time audience profiling and other core services
		within the Adobe 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword> (via the Master Marketing Profile),
		use of these services might impact which data center (and country) your data
		resides. Specifically, because the core services of the Adobe 
		<keyword>Marketing Cloud</keyword> leverage Adobe audience management,
		data used within the Master Marketing Profile must reside within audience
		management servers in the United States. 
	 </p>
    <p> When leveraging core services made available via the Master Marketing
		Profile, the types of data sent from other Adobe products to audience
		management are: 
	 </p>
    <ul id="ul_24C297A5B911455FBE616E8EEBF25B03">
      <li id="li_7CBD656B6DDA44E59924F1D98DD9EA99">
        <keyword>Analytics</keyword> key/value pairs (props, eVars, list vars,
		  and so on). By default, the log lines include IP address, including the last
		  octet of the IP (assuming that the IP address was not modified by IP
		  obfuscation settings within Adobe 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword>). 
		</li>
      <li id="li_EAF0FC4C5E8B4A6FB6A7FDA12B195198"> Traits and segments that
		  visitors qualify for based on rules set up in audience management. 
		</li>
      <li id="li_9BD8C3F92D6D4ADDBFAE95D81B8D9AAA">(Optional) One or more of
		  your IDs. Depending on your implementation of the ID service, you might also be
		  sending in one or more of your IDs, such as CRM IDs or hashed email addresses.
		  If this data is sent into Adobe 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword>, it is transferred to Adobe audience
		  management. 
		  <p>Adobe recommends against providing personal data to Adobe 
			 <keyword>Analytics</keyword>. Rather, use a one-way hash to
			 pseudonymize the data before it is sent to Adobe. 
		  </p></li>
      <li id="li_F6AF92F8BB374D019C72FB5A9DF32178">Segments originating in 
		  <keyword>Analytics</keyword> via the back-end segment sharing
		  capability. 
		</li>
    </ul>
    <p> All of these data elements are delivered to Adobe audience management
		in the form of log files. Audience management processes and stores this data
		within the United States. Audience management does not provide an option to
		store or process this data outside of the United States. 
	 </p>
    <p> As a reminder, Adobe has certified under the US-EU Safe Harbor program.
		This certification covers all of the Adobe Marketing Cloud products. This
		program allows for Adobe to process and store personal data from EU residents
		in a manner compliant with the EU Data Protection Directive. In addition, the 
		<xref href="http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/security/pdfs/adobe-marketingcloud-security-wp-web.pdf" format="http" scope="external">Adobe Marketing Cloud Security</xref> white
		paper describes Adobe's security practices for the Adobe Marketing Cloud, which
		includes Adobe audience management.

      <b>Cookies and Opt-Outs</b>
    </p>
    <p> Use of real-time audience profiling leverages the audience management
		cookie, in addition to the cookies used for 
		<keyword>Analytics</keyword> and 
		<keyword>Target</keyword>. 
	 </p>
    <p>If you want to provide the proper opt-out ability, visitors to your site
		must add the audience management opt-out to your existing opt-out process.
