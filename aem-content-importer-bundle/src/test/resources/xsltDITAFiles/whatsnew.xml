		<title>Creative Cloud Asset Sharing in Marketing Cloud</title> 
		<p>Creating Cloud users who have joined the Marketing Cloud can share
		  folders and assets. To share assets, users must be members of the tenant (your
		  company name) in the Marketing Cloud. For example, if you log in at 
		  <filepath>&lt;yourcompany&gt;.marketing.adobe.com</filepath>, users
		  must belong to the 
		  <filepath>&lt;yourcompany&gt;</filepath> tenant. 
		</p> 
		<p>• Folder share set up in Marketing Cloud 
		</p> 
		<p>• MAC login as Assets admin, with access to solutions/assets. 
		</p> 
		<p>• MAC Assets Admin creates whitelist of Creative Cloud users,
		  add/remove/edit list (using Adobe ID), with invitation status. 
		</p> 
		<p>• MAC user can create a folder, add assets, and prepare to share with
		  creatives.
		</p> 
		<p>• Select and invite Creative Cloud users to shared folder 
		</p> 
		<p>• Select sharing action and choose from Admin managed creative user
		  list. 
		</p> 
		<p>• Invitations sent to creative users, includes link to folder (both
		  web and email). 
		</p> 
		<p>• Creative Cloud users sync assets to shared folders 
		</p> 
		<p>• Creatives can start adding assets to shared folder (replicated to
		  MAC) via both desktop and web. 
		</p> 
		<p>• Collaboration takes place at assets level through shared commenting.
		  
		</p> 
		<p>• MAC users can unshare a folder, when project is completed, and may
		  re-share with others to continue workflows. 
		</p> 
		<p>• MAC users can then leverage MAC/Asset integrations with Target and
		  Social to execute complete optimization and social media campaigns. 
		</p> 
		<p>Overall benefits include: 
		</p> 
		<p>• Reduced time to market 
		</p> 
		<p>• Streamlined creative production workflows (incl. external agencies)
		  by reducing coordination time for review/ approve/ publish phases. 
		</p> 
		<p>• Easy to save, share, and send files between creatives and marketers 
		</p> 
		<p>• Spend less time managing in-process files/versions in multiple
		  locations 
		</p> 
		<p>• Streamline marketing campaign workflows with centralized access to
		  shared approved assets for MC solutions, i.e., Target &amp; Social. 
		</p> 
		<p>• Reduced costs 
		</p> 
		<p>• Ability to track and manage creative assets more efficiently. 
		</p> 
		<p>• Reduced asset duplication across repositories 
		</p> 
		<p>• Reduce administrative tasks of data migration as users come &amp; go
		  
		</p> 
		<p>• Higher levels of IP security/ protection 
		</p> 
		<p>• Security and enterprise ownership is key 
		</p> 
		<p>• Retain control and protection over company IP (CC/MC enterprise
		  owned) 
		</p> 
		<p>• Retain creative IP as creatives come and go.
